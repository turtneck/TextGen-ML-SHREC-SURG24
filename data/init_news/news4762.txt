Donald Trumps flailing campaign has prompted Democrats to launch a new broad effort to offer Hillary Clinton as a safe harbor for Republicans who find they can no longer stomach the GOP presidential nomineeClintons campaign is quietly broadening its outreach to potential Republican converts including donors elected officials and business and foreign policy leaders The message is simple Even if you have never before considered voting for a Democrat and even if you dont like Clinton choosing her this year is a moral and patriotic imperativeDuty honor country is how one person familiar with recent campaign outreach put itThe recruitment is a continuation of the campaigns efforts to sway influential Republicans and independents which began in earnest as Trump appeared likely to secure the GOP nomination during the springIt escalated during and after the Republican convention which drew fewer senior elected Republicans than usual and included scenes of discord Trump himself helped the Clinton cause most with remarks on the economy and foreign policy during and after the Democratic convention Clinton aides said Chief among those was a public feud with the family of a Muslim soldier Humayun Khan who died in battle in IraqThis week his refusal to endorse House Speaker Paul D Ryan of Wisconsin or Sen John McCain of Arizona during their primaries this month has further alienated mainstream conservatives and Republican establishment figuresThe Clinton campaign would not discuss the recruitment effort in detail including specific additional targets among Republican elected officials or other leaders But according to several Democrats with knowledge of the effort it includes personal appeals to target luminaries by senior Democrats including John Podesta Clintons campaign chairman The campaign is also tracking Republicans who have spoken out against Trump in public even if they have stopped short of endorsing ClintonThe idea is to make Republican voters more comfortable supporting Clinton by showing them examples of leaders in many realms who have chosen to disavow Trump as a matter of principle The effort combines Clinton campaign staff and resources with outside gobetweens Clinton officials saidWhen you look at what went on at the Republican convention and then in contrast the Democratic convention for a lot of Republicans this was their moment to take that close look at the two candidates Clinton chief strategist and pollster Joel Benenson saidA lot of people are waking up and saying What am I doing here Lets see what I hear on the other side They have to look for a place to land thats in the best interest of the countryBenenson noted that Republicans themselves have begun an organic effort to encourage one another to reject TrumpSeveral Republicans were among a group of former cabinet officers senior officials and career military officers who denounced Trump on Thursday calling his recent remarks on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia disgracefulThe open letter takes issue with Trump statements that appear to question the alliance encourage Russia to hack and release Clintons deleted State Department emails and seem to recognize Russias annexation of Crimea which the United States considers illegitimate The letter does not endorse Clinton although several of the individual signers have done so separatelyThere are people Republicans saying its time to put country before party Thats not a thing any Democrat can say to a Republican Thats something only a Republican can say to a Republican Benenson said in an interviewThe Clinton campaign invited several Republicans to make that argument at the Democratic convention last week including Douglas G Elmets a White House spokesman under former president Ronald ReaganTrump appeals to our basest instincts our worst selves said Elmets who has taken it upon himself to write opeds appear on television and speak out in other ways to encourage other Republicans to support ClintonElmets said he was asked to speak at the convention by a friend active in Democratic politics in California who acted as a gobetween with convention organizersAt the end of the day I can see the fish rotting at the head said Elmets referring to Trumps effect on the Republican PartySince the close of the convention Clinton secured the public endorsement of entrepreneur sports team owner and reality TV personality Mark Cuban who had earlier indicated that he might vote for Trump She was also endorsed by HewlettPackard executive and Republican fundraiser Meg Whitman More are in the works including Republicans who have held senior foreign policy roles in the executive branch and Congress Democrats familiar with the effort saidIn addition retiring Rep Richard Hanna of New York became the first sitting Republican member of Congress to endorse Clinton this week Senior campaign aides to former Florida governor Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie two former GOP candidates also said they are backing ClintonIt remains unclear whether trotting out Republican endorsers will translate to significantly more Republican support at the pollsIn the battleground state of North Carolina Clinton is likely to have a tough time courting Republicans but its probably worth the effort said Carter Wrenn a longtime GOP strategist Wrenn estimated about 20 percent of Republicans there dont like Hillary at all but they dont care for Trump eitherThe question is whether they pass on the presidential race entirely Wrenn said I dont think Hillary is going to get many Republican votes and I think she knows that But just neutralizing those voters he said could be helpful in a race that is most likely to be decided by which candidate can better mobilize independentsCampaign officials and close Clinton allies cautioned that the Republican outreach is not a foundation for her election strategy which focuses chiefly on women Hispanics and younger voters and holding onto the battleground states President Obama won in 2012Were not going to forget where we came from but we know there is a window to reach beyond our traditional supporters and were going to try very hard to reach these folks a Clinton aide saidIt is also worth noting that even as Democrats court Republicans the candidate is pressing ahead on the campaign trail with a jobsandeconomy message that keeps her out of the way of the damaging news coverage Trump has brought upon himselfAnd they say they are not taking victory for granted even as they seize on this new opportunity Clinton strategists do not expect that the doubledigit lead she has opened in some battleground state polls this week will lastBill and Hillary Clinton were described as circumspect and not giddy by a person who spoke to them recentlyEveryone just assumes this is a slog that person saidBut the campaign and its outside allies are feeling more confident with roughly three months to go before the electionThe proClinton super PAC Priorities USA did not renew its ads in Colorado and Virginia Spokesman Justin Barasky said the PAC plans to return to the airwaves in both battleground states at the end of the month but the lapse is a sign that both the campaign and PAC view the two states as safer than beforeOn Thursday Clinton visited an energy company founded by a prominent local Republican in Nevada Clinton used the stop at Mojave Electric to highlight a piece of her jobs plan that would reward businesses such as owner Dennis Nelsons with a 1500 tax credit for each apprentice they hireEarlier this week she toured a small necktie manufacturer in Colorado to tout American manufacturing and zing Trump for making his Trumpbranded ties overseasBut Trumps tough week has been met by relative silence on the Clinton trail The principle is to let Trump dominate the news cycle while Clinton garners local headlines on her jobs planAfter the Denver stop on Wednesday for example the Denver Posts threecolumn frontpage headline read Clinton pledges millions of jobsWhenever any political candidate is doing damage to themselves every day the wisest course of action is  within reasonable limits  to stay out of the news and allow the other candidate to continue to do damage said Jerry Crawford a longtime Clinton allyAfter appearing with Clinton at a rally in Las Vegas Sen Harry M Reid DNev warned Democrats not to be overconfident But citing recent polling he said Clintons electoral map has the potential to extend to deeply red statesReid said Georgia Arizona and Utah are three states where Clinton could potentially do well in the race against TrumpI hope the map is expanded Reid told reporters It would be good for the countryAccording to a person close to a proClinton super PAC the outlook for the fall has not changed significantly since the conventions and they expect Clintons bump in the polls and Trumps rough patch to both level offHer allies view the task of electing a Democrat to three consecutive presidential terms as monumental making a landslide election rare in recent history and unlikely for Clinton  even against Trump It is particularly difficult they say given that more than half of Americans have said in recent polling that the country is on the wrong trackWe are sailing into spectacular head winds the person said
