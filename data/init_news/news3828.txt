Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Sunday that the United States is not winning the battle against the Islamic State and called on Congress to update the useofforce authorization passed after Sept 11 2001 to give President Obama more options to fight the militant group But she stopped short of calling for a declaration of warClinton said she expects to hear Obama discuss an intensification of efforts to fight terrorism when he delivers a primetime address from the Oval Office on Sunday night White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in a statement that the president will detail the steps our government is taking to fulfill his highest priority keeping the American people safeClinton seemed to think that message might not go far enough I think thats what well hear from the president an intensification of the existing strategy she said in response to a question from George Stephanopoulos on ABCs This Week And I think theres some additional steps we have to takeRepublican presidential candidates who appeared on the Sunday talk shows such as former Florida governor Jeb Bush Ohio Gov John Kasich and Sen Marco Rubio RFla repeated their attack that the president has no strategy to defeat the group and called on him to commit to some type of military ground strategy in addition to airstrikesWerenot winning but its too soon to say that we are doing everything we need to do Clinton said And Ive outlined very clearlywe have to fight them in the air we have to fight them on ground and we have to fight on the Internet And we have to do everything we can with our friends and partners around the world to protect ourselvesI think thats what well hear from the president an intensification of the existing strategy and I think theres some additional steps we have to takeRepublican presidential candidate Jeb Bush who appeared later in the show said Clinton was playing word games They areat war with us and we should have a strategy not just to restrain but to destroy them Bush said We have to get the lawyers off the warfighters backsBush joined Rubio and Kasich Sunday in saying that the Senate was right to reject guncontrol legislation offered by Democrats in the wake of the San Bernardino Calif shootingBut Clinton in arguing for additional gun control linked the San Bernardino attacks with shootings within recent weeks that were no related to international terrorismWhat happened in San Bernardino was a terrorist act Nobody is arguing with that The law enforcement FBI have come to that conclusion And lets not forget though a week before we had an American assault on Planned Parenthood and some weeks before that we had an assault at a community college Clinton saidSo I dont see these two as in any way contradictory she added We have to up our game against terrorists abroad and at home and we have to take account of the fact that our gun laws and the easy access to those guns by people who shouldnt get them mentally ill people fugitives felons and the Congress continuing to refuse to prohibit people on the nofly list from getting guns which include a lot of domestic and international terrorists these are two parts of the same approach that Im taking to make us safeVermont Sen Bernie Sanders who also is running for the Democratic nomination agreed with Clinton about banning people on nofly and watch lists from buying guns The two have sparred over his commitment to gun control because Sanders voted a decade ago for a comprehensive gun bill that included amnesty from lawsuits for gun manufacturersSanders on CBSs Face the Nation Sunday cautioned that gun control was not the solution to stopping terrorism I dont think anybody believes its a magic formula he said later adding I dont think its very hard to understand that terrorists or potential terrorists should not have guns People who are being barred from flying on airplanes should not have gunsReferring to Obamas upcoming address on terrorism Dickerson asked Sanders what he would say to the public if he were president What I would say is that we have got to be as aggressive as we can in destroying ISIS but we have to learn the lessons of the past Sanders said And that means we cannot do it alone It must be an international coalition in which the Muslim nations are the troops on the groundRepublican candidates argued that prohibiting people on watch lists from purchasing guns was ineffective because the lists are inaccurate Rubio and Bush noted that the late Democratic Sen Edward Kennedys name appeared on a nofly list Instead they say Obama needs to come up with a plan to defeat the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq to reduce the chances of more attacks on US soilRubio during an interview on CNNs State of the Union said the nofly list is not a perfect database and shouldnt be used as a tool to impede 700000 Americans or potential Americans  people on that list from having access to be able to fully utilize their Second Amendment rightsThe first impulse of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama is to have gun control Bush said Lets have a strategy to take out ISIS there so we dont have to deal with them here ISIS is an alternative acronym for the Islamic StateClinton again rejected the use of the term radical Islam arguing that sounds like we are declaring war against a religion  I dont want to do that because number one it doesnt do justice to the vast numbers of Muslims in our own country and around the world who are peaceful people She said the term also helps to create this clash of civilizations that is actually a recruiting tool for ISIS and other radical jihadists who use this as a way of saying were in a war against the West You must join us If you are a Muslim you must join usDonald Trump immediately attacked Clinton saying on Twitter that she was afraid to use that languageNew Jersey Gov Chris Christie also criticized Democrats for avoiding the term This is the problem with the president and with Secretary Clinton who provide leadership by euphemism They wont say radical Islamic jihadists Christie said on CBSs Face the NationNow when you say radical Islamic jihadists they understand the rest of the Muslim community understands the folks who are peaceful and who attend mosques in a peaceful way work in our country raise their families pay their taxes they know theyre not radical Islamic jihadists he said Thats why we need to use the words because it differentiates them from the peaceful lawabiding American Muslims who play by the rules and raise their families and dont want to see this kind of conduct going on
