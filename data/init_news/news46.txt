The president now plans to continue a US ground force presence in Afghanistan to help hold off the Taliban until he leaves office This is an uncommon turnaround for a president who hasnt changed his mind on foreign policy since drawing his muchballyhooed and promptly ignored red line in SyriaSo what does this rare shift have to say about Obamas foreign policy and Americas future role in Afghanistan Not muchMr Obama started his presidency hoping to use Afghanistan to demonstrate his willingness to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty in the national security business He asserted that unlike Bushs War in Iraq fighting in the place where the 911 attacks were concocted was worth itIn approving a surge in Afghanistan the president made much of his role as deciderinchief Yet even as he sent in more troops he tipped his hand that Afghanistan was not as much an exception to the talkdontfight Obama Doctrine as the toughguy image he sought to cultivateThe president gave commanders only half the force and half the time they requested to do the job right It turned out the commanders were right Mr Obama however had his eye on the next election and wanted to go into the race showing he had put the war on a glidepath to wind down and pull outSignaling a limitedtime interest in fighting an enemy rarely ends well The Taliban adopted the logical and predictable strategy of simply waiting out Mr Obama Also predictably the halfmeasure surge and overly ambitious transfer of responsibility to the Afghan military resulted in unnecessarily heavy casualties for Afghan security forces a persistent Taliban and a shaky security situationNevertheless Afghanistan is far from a total failure Indeed compared to the presidents other foreign policy dalliancesfrom the Russian reset to Libya to Syria to Iraq to Ukraine it ranks as his best achievement yetWhich is why Mr Obama is reportedly backing away from his plan to yank virtually all US troops out of Afghanistan by the end of next year Instead he has agreed to leave the current force of 9800 troops in place throughout most of next year and keep 5500 in theater thereafterIts a good call With the Taliban flexing its muscles anew and the Islamic State making inroads there completely pulling out makes little sense Mr Obama can ill afford another complete foreign policy disaster on his watch Further virtually everyone the US military the Afghans Pakistan India our NATO allies wants the US to stay and see the job throughIn addition there is zero domestic pressure for the president to make good on his campaign promise An appearance of Code Pink is about as common as a Yeti sighting And in the debates thus far presidential candidates have devoted about as much time to Afghanistan as they have to defunding Public TelevisionIt makes complete sense for Mr Obama to tough it out in Afghanistan but dont expect the change in plans to make things better for the Afghans or the larger security picture The US presence is the bare minimum to hold on More forces with loser rules of engagement would make the country much safer much fasterBut holding on is probably the best we can hope for with this president Heres hoping the next Commander in Chiefs attitude toward Afghanistan will focus more on solving problems than just wishing they would go awayJames Jay Carafano is vice president of foreign and defense policy studies The Heritage Foundation Follow him on Twitter JJCarafano
