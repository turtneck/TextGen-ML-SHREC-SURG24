at 143 pm 3 Comments By now everyone on planet earth has heard about the bombshell news just announced by the FBI that it was reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server Heres the text of FBI head James Comeys letter to Congressional leaders Obviously lots of people are out there pontificating on what if anything this means As such Im going to add my two cents to the conversation Ive prided myself on unemotionally calling this election how I see it the whole time because Im neither a Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump supporter Being free of the tremendous baggage that comes with cheerleading a particular candidate in this contentious election I had consistently predicted a Trump victory until the Access Hollywood tape emerged At that point I penned a thoughtpiece titled Donald Trump is in Trouble  Part 2  in which I changed my forecast to a Hillary Clinton victory Heres some of what I wrote After watching yesterdays audio and reading through the Wikileaks revelations my prediction has changed for the first time this election All things equal from here on out meaning no additional huge revelations against Hillary I think Hillary Clinton will defeat Donald Trump I dont think its going to be a landslide but I think shes probably going to win The audio was very harmful for Donald Trump and now Im going to explain why First of all if you want to accurately forecast the outcome of this election you need to get into the minds of the masses Just like trading financial markets what you think is right doesnt matter What matters is what everyone else collectively thinks and whether or not theyre going to get off their asses and vote A big part of why I thought Trump would win related to the fact that I believe many people were simply looking for an excuse to vote for him Justified disgust with the status quo in general and Hillary Clinton in particular pushed millions of Americans into the camp of being willing to take a gamble on Trump despite disliking him personally and disagreeing with him on many issues I felt strongly that there were millions upon millions of Americans you could place into this category  people who were flirting with the idea of voting Trump I believe a significant amount of these people will not vote for him as a result of the audio Will it be the majority of them Probably not but it will be a material number and arguably enough to swing the election No I dont think these voters will shift to Hillary and no I dont think committed Trump voters will change their minds However I do think enough of these willing to be convinced leaningTrump types will now stay home or vote third party Its these voters who I expected to swing the election in Trumps favor and they are now unreliable Does Trumps vulgarity excuse the incalculable crimes of Hillary Clinton and her husband making them preferable in this election No it doesnt but thats not the point of this article Most voters are too superficial too busy trying to survive and too uninformed to weigh all the very important issues rationally As an example think about how most conversations are going to go down this weekend Lets say youre out with a bunch of friends for drinks tonight Someone says so have you seen the Trump audio If someone in the group hasnt someone will pull out their phone and itll be watched in 3 minutes What if someone then says yeah but have you seen the leaked Hillary emails What will your response be You cant adequately explain the importance of that to your friends in 3 minutes Instead youll have to send them a lengthy article that theyll never read So by the end of this weekend pretty much everyone in America will have heard the Trump audio while maybe 10 will take the time to analyze what came out of Wikileaks There goes your election Understanding the craziness of the election I finished the piece with the following Despite all of that I still cant say with certainty that Hillary will win However I do think the landscape has changed enough that for the first time this entire election season I am no longer confident of a Trump victory Then again I was absolutely convinced that Hillary was unelectable after she collapsed on 911 and mislead everyone about her health and I was wrong about that Thats how completely crazy this election is and theres still a month to go Anything can happen particularly with the debate coming up this Sunday So while its certainly not out of the question there will have to be some very material events over the next month to put Trump back in the drivers seat While the Wikileaks emails have been an important factor in keeping this race close I didnt think they were sufficient to alter my forecast of a Clinton victory I think the reopening of the FBI investigation is enough of a black swan to materially change the course of this race Clinton supporters will read this and think Im insane They will think this because they are anticipating a landslide victory for Hillary I never expected a landslide so I think this news tips the election into a total tossup situation My reasoning for the change is the same that led me to switch my forecast to Hillary after the Access Hollywood video was released The primary reason I initially thought Trump would win related to the fact I believed enough people would be willing to vote for a person they dont really like in order to blow up the status quo I felt that the video recording of Trumps vulgar commentary was enough to put those people into the absentee or third party column despite millions of Americans looking for an excuse to vote for Trump due to the well understood awfulness of Hillary This has changed and voters now have the excuse they needed to vote Trump That reason is simple The problems with Hillary Clinton will never go away They will always resurface or new problems will emerge and it has nothing to do with a vast rightwing conspiracy or Putin It has to do with her It has to do with the fact that her and her husband are career crooks warmongers and shameless looters of the American public This reopening of the FBI investigation just hammers all of that home for everyone We know what 4 years of Hillary will look like Itll be Obama cronyism on steroids plus endless investigations with a side of World War 3 I dont think people want that and so more Americans than the pundits realize will take a gamble on Trump As a caveat the above forecast assumes this new FBI investigation is not closed before November 8th If it is I think shell win If not I think Trump has even odds to win if not better Of course with 11 days left in this crazy election many more black swans could emerge Stay tuned In Liberty
