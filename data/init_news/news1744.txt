Donald Trump spent a day in January 2014 hobnobbing with politicians at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach Fla The billionaire mogul touted legalizing gambling with state Rep Steve Crisafulli speaker of the Florida House and two other wired Florida Republicans plugging his properties as potential sites for casinosBut as they tapped putts on the manicured greens something else was on Trumps mind Jeb BushHe was trashing Jeb and quite honestly I dont think hes ever held Jeb in high regard said Crisafulli a Bush supporter who said he was uncomfortable with the conversation and defended the former Florida governor to Trump Ive met with Mr Trump on several occasions and hes constantly had things to say about Jeb  Hes always had a negative connotation about JebTrumps jeering that day was a harbinger of the taunts and derision that the 2016 GOP frontrunner has directed at Bush on the campaign trail this summerThe feud between the leading Republicans which has escalated in recent days is shaping up as a defining dynamic at this early stage of the race And considering Trumps dominant status in polls and Bushs fundraising ability the tensions between the two are likely to be a factor for weeks or months to come as each candidate attempts to topple the other on his way to the nominationThe 2016 campaign is only the latest manifestation of decades of discord between Trump and the Bush family Since the gilded 1980s when Trump and George HW Bush rose as forces in their respective spheres the relationship between Trump and the Bushes has been a melodrama  veering between displays of public affection and acerbic insultsAt the core there are clashes of style manner and class between the Bushes  a patrician clan of presidents governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations  and Trump a hustling New York City dealmaker who turned his fathers outerborough real estate portfolio into a goldplated empireThe Bushes were never Trumps cup of tea said Roger Stone a longtime confidant and former adviser to Trump Asked why the Bushes often have kept Trump at arms length he said Hes not from old WASP money The Trumps didnt come on the MayflowerHes not up to snuffTrump shrugs off the suggestion that his rivalry with the Bushes is rooted in pedigree although he is open about his animosity toward them he characterizes his relationship with former president Bill Clinton for instance as far closerHe lashed out at former president George W Bush over the war in Iraq during his tenure He turned on Bushs father when he raised taxes during his term as president despite pledging not to do soBut Trump reserves particular personal ire for Jeb Bush whose first name he commonly mocks by drawing it out in a slight drawl One Trump associate who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly said of Trump Hes very smart hes driven and he has two goals one to be elected president and two to have Jeb not be presidentIn a 35minute interview this week with The Washington Post tracing his history with the Bushes Trump unleashed a hailstorm of scorn He found 33 ways to skewer the family  about one putdown per minuteOn Jeb Bush I mean this guy I dont think he has a clueOn George HW Bush I really liked the father  really like him as a person But I hated his read my lips no more taxes and then he raised taxes monstrouslyOn George W Bush He didnt seem smart Id watch him in interviews and Id look at people and ask Do you think he understands the questionAnd back to Jeb Hes not up to snuff  Jeb is never going to bring us to the promised land He cantTrump was especially accusatory when he talked about Jeb Bushs work in investment banking After leaving the governors office in 2007 Bush was an adviser to Lehman Brothers and later Barclays making between 13 million and 2 million a year Trump called Bushs role at Lehman a noshow job and suggested it was a reward for helping direct Florida state funds to the firm whose collapse in 2008 helped kick off the Great RecessionThats a Hillary Clinton kind of situation Trump said referring to the Democratic frontrunner This is huge Let me ask you Why would you pay a man 13 million a year for a noshow job at Lehman Brothers  which when it failed almost took the world with itAsked whether he thought Bush was ready to steer the nations economy Trump said Steer it He cant steer himselfTim Miller a Bush spokesman said Trump is trafficking in false conspiracy theories about LehmanResponding to Trumps broader criticisms Miller highlighted the developers past ties to Democrats and liberal causesWhile Trump was attending New York liberal cocktail parties and trashing conservatives and Republican presidents any chance he got Jeb was the most conservative governor in the country cutting taxes reining in the size of government and protecting life Miller saidIn Florida Bushs associates have been flummoxed by the pace and intensity of Trumps assaults Former governor Bob Martinez a Bush friend and supporter asked Is this the way he acts when hes negotiating with somebodySome find it entertaining some find it odd Martinez said This is not the normal fare you get certainlyBush has begun firing back on the stump though not with Trumps vigor and mostly without naming his opponent There are some people running theyre really talented about filling space  about saying big things he said Wednesday in Pensacola Fla They think that volume in their language is a kind of a version of leadership Talking is not leadership Doing is leadershipAl Cardenas another Bush friend suggested Trumps motivation is pure politics He wants to win this thing he sees Jeb as the big gorilla with the big superPAC money and someone who would eventually be the one facing him in the homestretchCardenas also surmised that Trump had been a nonfactor in Bushs mindIn a thousand conversations Ive ever had with Jeb Ive never heard Donald Trump mentioned once until last year Cardenas said He was just not a part of Jeb world in any way that I recallTrump fondly remembers one of his first encounters with the Bush family patriarch It was 1988 and he hosted George HW Bush for a presidential campaign fundraiser at the Plaza Hotel the palatial New York property Trump owned at the timeI remember Don King was there Trump said in the interview Big Don King  Hes shaking Bushs hand and saying Only in America And you know Don Kings voice Its like Pavarotti rightTrump soured on Bush when he increased taxes but they eventually made amends In 1997 Trump said Bush asked him to host a fundraiser for his son Jeb who was running for Florida governor Trump agreed The event was in his apartment at Trump TowerIt was not merely a political favor Trump had been trying to persuade Florida lawmakers to allow his company to manage casinos on tribal landI had a fundraiser and raised about 1 million which in those days was a lot of money Trump said In fact I remember Jeb Bush saying It was the most successful fundraiser Ive ever hadTrump said George HW Bush wrote him a beautiful note thanking me for helping with his sonNevertheless Trumps swipes at the elder Bush continued and extended onto the pages of his 2000 book The America We Deserve In it he said the 41st president failed to comprehend that he was in the bubble created by the American presidency and simply lost touchIn that same book Trump praised Jeb Bush as a good man who is exactly the kind of political leader this country needs now and will very much need in the future  I believe we could get another president from the BushesTrumps unpredictable commentary led most Bush insiders to keep their distance Nicholas F Brady a family intimate and former treasury secretary said in an interview that the Bush circle has rarely overlapped with Trump politically and sociallyAs for the pot shots at Jeb these days Brady said He must understand that Donalds way of expressing himself is different He tends to shorthop problems and thats his style We cant do much about thatFormer ambassador Mel Sembler a Bush family friend and fundraiser said he attended the 1997 event at Trump Tower and suggested that the current animus must be newfoundYou dont have animosity toward somebody and then put on a fundraiser in your home Sembler said I would never put on a fundraiser  and I put on an awful lot of them  unless it was somebody I really felt like would be a great political leaderI have never tried to clickIn 1999 as thenTexas Gov George W Bush was consolidating the Republican establishment behind his 2000 presidential candidacy Trump explored a run of his own in the Reform Party which grew out of the 1992 independent run of Ross Perot that many Republicans were convinced cost Bushs father his reelectionTrump went on CNNs Larry King Live and said Bush had not been forthcoming enough about his problems with alcohol Later that fall Trump made a splashy visit to Miami Jeb Bushs adopted home town Rallying Cuban Americans in Little Havana Trump knocked George W Bush and thenVice President Al Gore by saying that his wealth made him more qualified to be president than the two descendants of politicians because they were as he put it anointedIn the end Trump did not run But by George W Bushs second term in the Oval Office Trump had become a thorn in the presidents side In the runup to Bushs 2004 reelection Trump criticized his management of the Iraq war By 2007 he declared that Bush was a horrible president  possibly the worst in the history of this countryTrump said in the Post interview that he blames Bush for the rise of the Islamic State terrorist group which has seized parts of Iraq and neighboring SyriaI was very much opposed to the war in Iraq he said The brother went in and destabilized the entire region If Jebs brother didnt do that with Iraq I dont think youd have a destabilized Middle East right nowDuring Jeb Bushs two terms as governor even as his business interests expanded in South Florida Trump shunned himIve never tried to click he said If I devoted time to being friendly with them dont you think Id be friendly with themInstead Trump cultivated ties to Bush allies in Tallahassee inviting them to play golf or to dine with him in Manhattan or South FloridaRecounting one outing with former state House speaker Will Weatherford R Trump said I think they were more impressed with my golf game than anything else if you want to know the truth  I shot 72Weatherford said this week that he did not remember Trump shooting 72Mr Trump seems to always have an optimistic view of his abilities Weatherford wrote in an email I respect him and his candidacy but I am a Jeb Bush supporter like most current and former public officials in
