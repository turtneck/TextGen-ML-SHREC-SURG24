In a speech in Chicago Wednesday Jeb Bush will offer his views on foreign policy As a former governor of Florida he has a clear record on domestic policies but his views on foreign policy are less knownWhen Jeb Bush steps to a Chicago podium Wednesday morning to deliver a speech on his foreign policy views the question on many minds will be which other Bush the notquiteyetdeclared presidential candidate sounds more likeWill Jeb Bush offer a hawkish Americaswayorthehighway vision of foreign policy suggesting hed follow in his brother George W Bushs interventionist neoconservative footsteps Or will he offer hints  through references for example to Americas leadership of broad coalitions to address global challenges  of a more cautious and internationalist approach reminiscent of his father George HW BushOr then again will he meld the two visions which do after all represent the two most prominent camps of Republican foreign policy thinking Or will he somehow manage to sound like neither the father nor the brotherSuch questions almost never arise when it comes to Mr Bushs domestic policy vision since the former Florida governor has a record and established public views on issues ranging from education and fiscal policy to immigrationIndeed when Bush speaks of a right to rise and share in Americas economic opportunities no one asks whether that sounds more like the fathers or the brothers domestic economic approach But on foreign policy he is much more of a clean slate  and so the question of which former Bush president he would more likely emulate cant help but come upEvery candidate has to pass the commanderinchief threshold test and every candidate faces certain mine fields in passing that test says Peter Feaver professor of political science and public policy at Duke University in Durham NC The particular mine field for Jeb Bush is the advantage and the burden of his family nameFor starters Bush will have to watch not to overreact to the media pressure particularly on foreign policy to answer the question Are you your brother or are you your dad  Professor Feaver saysFurthermore the memory of pitched foreign policy battles in the George W Bush White House between father Bushs pragmatic internationalist wing think thenSecretary of StateColin Powell and the muscular neoconservatives behind the Iraq War Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld then vice president and secretary of Defense is sure to be on the minds of theforeign policy experts who will parse every word that Jeb Bush utters Wednesday His talk is at the Chicago Council on Global AffairsOne hint of Bushs preferred foreign policy course comes from the former officials he admires and those he is consulting with ashe explores a run Bush is said to particularly value the contributions of former Secretary of State James Baker and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft  two pillars of the first President Bushs pragmatic and internationalist foreign policy approach Neither Bush I icon was particularly welcome at the Bush II White HouseWord has leaked out that Bush is consulting with former Deputy Secretary of State and former World Bank president Robert Zoellick the mildmannered Mr Zoellick left the George W Bush administration in 2006 after failing to rise to No 1 at either State or Treasury and Richard Haass president of the Council on Foreign RelationsBush is also said to be considering making MeghanOSullivan who served in George W Bushs National Security Council advising on Iraq as his campaigns chief foreign policy adviser Ms OSullivan who now teaches the practice of international affairs at Harvard Universitys Belfer Center is closely associated with the Iraq War  which might be considered a negative given the wars low marks among the American publicBut OSullivan is also credited with the surge strategy of 2007 that is viewed as having stabilized Iraq and in some books she gets a star for weathering the demands of thenDefense Secretary Rumsfeld that she be removed from the post she held in postinvasion IraqYet while some foreign policy experts see a preference for the fathers foreign policy in the people Jeb Bush is consulting with others see a tendency toward the brothers vision in the few speeches he has made on foreign affairs In a December speech in Miami to a Cuba prodemocracy group Bush said that instead of lifting the embargo on Cuba I would argue that we should strengthen it to put pressure on the Cuban regimeHe also faulted President Obamas indecisiveness on Syria and other issues for bringing on more instability and increasing threats to the United StatesAny association with George W Bushs Iraq War might seem to spell political doom since large majorities of Americans continue to say that the heavy sacrifices and costs of the war were not worth it But on the other hand what may be riding to Jeb Bushs rescue is the recent shift in US public opinion on foreign policy  increasingly away from a mind our own business approach that had been gaining ground in the wake of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to a growing preference for more American interventionPublic opinion has turned around significantly over the last 14 months to favoring a much more robust US role in the world says Robert Lieber a professor of government and international affairs at Georgetown University in Washington I would assume that Jeb Bush would choose to tap into that as he lays out his foreign policyDuke Universitys Feaver who served in a national security capacity in George W Bushs White House says Jeb Bush will have to answer the Iraq War question at some point  and that hell have to do a better job than simply saying Ill talk about the future Its not about relitigating anything in the past  as he did in response to a question last weekHe needs a better answer than that on Iraq Feaver says He needs to explain how he would have done things differently  and betterBut he doesnt expect that to be part of what Bush says in ChicagoThe first big speech is about identifying the big questions around foreign policy today laying out who we are and whats our role in the world what are the big challenges we face and how we can do a better job over the next four years he says I wouldnt expect him to spend a lot of time on how hes different from his father or his brother
