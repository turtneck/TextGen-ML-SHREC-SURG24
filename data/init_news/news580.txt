well be presidential hopeful Donald J Trump A veteran of the real estate industry for several decades now Trump surely has renovated his share of properties buildings and even golf courses His latest project however could be his most ambitious the Bill of Rights itself Look at this thing The Donald said as he held a copy the seminal American document before a crowd of reporters Its old I mean its old like really old You hear what Im saying It is old When asked what his intentions for the document were Trump proposed a renovation of the foundational document just like he would any of his older buildings that didnt cut the mustard anymore I mean Ivana wasnt cutting it anymore so I got Marla Maples New is better I think we all know that new is better New equals better Sometimes you have to tear something down to make something new right And then its all better When asked what he specifically meant by tearing down the document that is the basis of this countrys inalienable rights Trump continued Hey look I dont know when this thing was written probably a long time ago like in the 1920s or something but it doesnt make any sense anymore I have a real problem with an old stinky document telling me how to live my life If were gonna make America great again the first thing we have to do is make these document new again and thats what Im gonna do on the first day in office Bingobango new document for the new America I mean really no one reads this stuff anymore The presidential hopeful was then asked how he planned to rejuvenate the Bill of Rights First of all some of this spooky language needs to get cleaned up Like how is a workingclass guy like me the average citizen supposed to understand this stuff The trial of all crimes except in cases of impeachment and in cases arising in the land or naval forces or in the militia when in actual service in time of War or public danger shall be by an Impartial Jury of the Vicinage with the requisite of unanimity for conviction the right of challenge and other accostomed sic requisites and no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherways sic infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment by a Grand Jury but if a crime be committed in a place in the possession of an enemy or blah blah blah Vicinage Thats not even a word is it Unanimity Impeachment These arent words like hammer dumptruck or bigly Theyre talking in circles Thats right theyre talking in circles So that ones gone Just out Accostomed Otherways These Founding Father clowns cant even spell Trumps furor grew as he read more of the document Freedom of religion No one goes to church anymore Who cares That ones going too All it does is protect these Muslims who blew up buildings God forbid they blow up my towers Thats out Freedom of speech Freedom to lie thats what I call it Freedom to lie like those bastards on CNN and Hillary over there This seventh here thats a doozy It says in all matters involving more than 20 dollars Thats a joke I tip 20 dollars at Starbucks when I get my coffee That ones out Due process of law  another joke Out This third one quartering soldiers whats that I have waaaay too much respect for our soldiers to start chopping them up into quarters I mean thats like serial killer stuff right No absolutely not I will not chop up soldiers On my first day in office I will find anyone who is trying to chop up American soldiers and make them pay When prompted that he may be misinterpreting the articles in the Bill Trump lashed back Of course I am Look at it some time Who can understand this stuff Of course Im misinterpreting this stuff Maybe this is how they talked in the 1920s but not now not in Trumps America And the ideas are just stupid Look at this fourth one No illegal search and seizure If I cant walk into someones house and arrest him how am I gonna maintain law and order If I cant just take someones stuff how am I gonna know whats going on in this country huh You tell me And this old piece of paper is trying to tell me when Im president  not if but when  Im gonna restore law and order This fourth one how many shootings in Chicago happened because my police have their hands tied by this stupid fourth amendment I mean thats what Im gonna do starting on the first day of my term The very first day Heres another peach no cruel and unusual punishment Whats that How else do you deal with terrorists Thats why we got soft These terrorists knew they could come over bombs some buildings kill a bunch of people and know this piece of paper was gonna make sure they didnt get their precious feeling hurt First day in office that ones out One reporter asked The Donald if he knew that the stinky old document he was holding was supposed to protect the American people from injustice and false legal claims He was also asked if he knew what quartered meant Hey Im not saying people dont have rights People have rights Of course people have rights Sure they do Im just saying they dont need all this stuff The first day Im in office the very first day Im gonna make a nice simple list of rights you know without all this fancy nonsense Its outdated We need something
