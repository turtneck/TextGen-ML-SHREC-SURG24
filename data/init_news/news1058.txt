Monsanto Behind 4YearsintheMaking Failed Peace Deal in Colombia Nov 7 2016 1 0 Colombians just refused a peace deal championed by President Juan Manuel Santos Caldern with the narrow margin of just 05 of the votes This would have ended 52 years of war in the country that has resulted in 250000 deaths thus far Though recent stories suggested the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC rebels who had been waging a guerilla war in Colombia had put down their arms  a surprising contributor to the prolonged hardship Colombians now face can be traced directly to Monsanto  Negotiations for the failed peace deal took four long years but behind the attempts to start fresh with hopes of incorporating FARC rebels into civil Colombian life the biotech and seedmonopolizing company Monsanto was waging a war of their own Members of the FARC rebel resistance have spent decades roaming the jungles of Columbia  bathing in creeks and sleeping in crude campsites  They like almost no other Colombian are familiar with the USColombian socalled antinarcotic war which allows Monsanto to spray the air with glyphosate widely known as the trademarked herbicide Roundup Once this herbicide reaches the jungle floor it destroys not only coca but also the many other plants that provide for indigenous Colombians needs This practice began in the 1980s In 1999 the campaign to spray glyphosate acquired an official status known as Plan Colombia Only just recently the Colombian government defied the US agreement and stopped the aerial spraying of crops used to make cocaine ending the 20year long Monsantoled environmental devastation What many dont know is that the US government pledged to fund the purchase of glyphosate herbicides from Monsanto supply the aircraft equipped with the means to spray and to train Colombian commandos to carry out the aerial onslaught  These planes faced an ongoing threat of receiving ground fire by FARC rebels FARC leader Timolen Jimnez real name is Rodrigo Londoo Echeverri known as Timochenko among partisans and a graduate of the Peoples Friendship University in Russia as well as a trained doctor said in an interview to Colombian newspaper VOZ In the regions where farm communities live close to coca crops the government accuses landowners of illegal coca production and using this excuse constantly airsprays their fields with glyphosate This chemical destroys coca randomly along with other agricultural crops causing irretrievable harm to animals and people especially to children seniors and pregnant women The result was that rebels attempted to shoot down planes to escape chemical death In an attempt to avoid the ground fire the USsupplied Monsantoherbicidefilled crop dusters would fly higher but continue their spraying becoming more willynilly in their aim The Colombian tropical rainforests are thus barbarically sprayed with millions of tons of Monsantos herbicide This is extraordinarily troublesome due to the fact that Colombia is considered one of the most important countries for maintaining biodiversity with almost 10 of all endemic plant species growing within its forests Moreover 6 million Colombians have had to flee their homes due to Monsantos spraying  Instead of eradicating crops youd think the biotech company was trying to eradicate people Indigenous Shuar leader from Scumbios Ecuador explains the situation  We always used to have a pharmacy in the jungle But now we cant find the trees and animals that we need The animals and fish have disappeared The birds too We have never seen anything like this before It has to be the result of the spraying We notice the effects immediately after the area is sprayed Birds animals and fish begin to disappear within a few weeks The health effects linger for weeks and even longer Additionally soil has lost its fertility water is polluted and multigenerational homesteads are uprooted Forests are quickly dying also Instead of the land being shepherded by Colombians biotech corporations use them to expand their geneticallymodified crop empires which are resistant to glyphosate What has assisted this expansion The war against Colombian guerrillas FARC representatives at peace talks in Havana were the ones who demanded Monsanto and the US stop spraying  As Russian journalist Elena Sharoykina has stated  Despite the support of the head of the government the glyphosate moratorium was criticized by the Colombian war faction and its US bosses Juan Carlos Pinzn Bueno the defense minister lvaro Uribe Vlez the former head of the government and Kevin Whitaker the US ambassador in Bogota have publicly opposed it They claimed it an undeserved concession for FARC and appealed to continue the aerial spraying of the herbicide for the sake of combating narcotics Of course its not only about coca plantations The US uses the antinarcotic campaign in Colombia as an easy excuse to eradicate FARC Washington is usually surprisingly tolerant to drug production when it brings profit   Nowadays the estimated number of active FARC members hardly exceeds 56 thousand people Its naive to think that several thousand of rebels trapped in jungle can control a transnational joint venture known as the Colombian cocaine industry worth tens of billions US dollars  One thing is clear in the face of a lost vote for peace Glyphosate and war have become synonyms now in Colombia That is why the moratorium on the aerial spraying of the herbicide wouldnt last long Already in April 2016 the Colombian government under US pressure and on the pretext of fighting the drug business resumed the use of glyphosate
