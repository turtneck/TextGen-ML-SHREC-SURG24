Generic drug prices have nearly quadrupled in the past five years  and Sen Bernie Sanders IVT has a plan to fix itOn Monday Sanders who is also running for the Democratic presidential nomination rolled out a proposal that would place strict limits on how quickly pharmaceutical companies could hike generic drug prices Specifically drug manufacturers would have to pay a rebate back to Medicaid if their drug prices grew faster than inflation Rep Elijah Cummings DMD is introducing the same bill in the HouseGeneric drugs are cheaper versions of drugs that have lost their patent But in recent years the prices for generic drugs have been rising quickly and inexplicably One report from pharmacy benefits manager Catamaran found that consumers paid on average 1314 for each prescription of the 50 most popular generics in 2010 By 2014 they paid 6210  a 373 percent increaseSanders has previously cited federal records at hearings showing that the prices of more than 1200 generic medications rose an average of 448 percent between July 2013 and July 2014Generic drugs are typically meant to make medicine cheaper giving patients lessexpensive access to the costly drug formulations that pharmaceutical companies develop You can see this clearly in the overthecounter market you can get 100 generic ibuprofen pills for 749  or pay 999 for the brandname drug AdvilGeneric drugs now compose more than 80 percent of all prescriptions dispensed annually in the United States and experts think thats helped slow the growth of overall drug spendingIn recent years though the market for generic prescription medications has become increasingly expensive with drug manufacturers hiking up generic prices This seems especially likely to happen when there is just one drug company making the generic giving that manufacturer pretty complete control over the prices it wants to chargeConsider the case of albendazole an antiparasite drug that helps kill an infection caused by worms Its not an especially common drug because it treats a relatively uncommon problem among lowerincome populations particularly refugees and immigrantsAlbendazoles patents expired years ago but theres still only one company that makes it GlaxoSmithKline GSK And recently the drugmaker has quietly hiked the price Data published in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the average cost Medicaid paid for an albendazole prescription has increased from 3610 in 2008 to 24130 in 2013This is the exact same drug the only difference is that in the span of six years its price tag rose sixfoldAnd albendazole isnt alone  there is a lot of data showing a steep increase in generic drug prices The National Community Pharmacist Association says its members have seen generic prices increase as much as 600 percent in recent yearsThe United States is one of the only developed countries that do not negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companiesIn Spain the United Kingdom and pretty much all other European countries the government sits down with drugmakers and haggles over how much it will pay Each country uses different negotiating tactics The United Kingdom for example runs its bargaining through the National Institute for Clinical Evaluation typically known by its acronym NICEThe United States works differently Federal law bars Medicare the countrys largest insurance plan from negotiating with drugmakers Once a pharmaceutical company sets its price the governmentrun plan that insures 49 million seniors is required to accept itThere are thousands of private insurers though and they often have little clout to demand lower prices Other countries are essentially buying in bulk like shopping at Costco The United States does the equivalent of going to the local grocery store  and paying moreWe dont have a NICE in the United States said Steven Pearson founder and president of the Institute for Clinical and Economic Reviews a nonprofit that evaluates evidence on medical tests We have a system that says If its better we have to provide this pill and you the drugmaker get to name the price Its not a market Its drugmakers saying what they wantSanderss new proposal wouldnt give the government the power to negotiate drug prices although that isalso an idea the Vermont senator supportsInstead it would require generic drug manufacturers to give Medicaid the program that covers lowincome Americans a rebate for any growth in drug prices above and beyond overall inflationDrug companies will almost certainly oppose this idea as it would cut into their profits  and theyll argue into their development of generic drugs Sometimes they will cite a shortage of raw materials as a reason for the price hikes and would likely point to that as reasons why they couldnt produce the drugs for less Pharma is a strong lobby and that along with overall gridlock in Congress would be a significant obstacle for this type of billStill the idea of rebates is not unprecedented in American health policy Federal law requires that Medicaid get a23 percent discount on all brandname drugs sticker prices And individual state Medicaid programs are allowed to negotiate even lower prices with drugmakers if they so choose The idea there was similar to the one in the Sanders bill making drug prices cheaper for the program that serves the lowestincome Americans
