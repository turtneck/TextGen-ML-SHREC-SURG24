Russian warplanes began airstrikes in Syria on Wednesday adding an unpredictable new element to a fouryearold war that has already drawn in the United States and allies fueled a refugee crisis and expanded the reach of the Islamic StateIn Washington the dramatic escalation of Russias military involvement was viewed as an affront just two days after President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin sat down to discuss means for negotiating the deep differences in their countries approaches to the conflict in SyriaThe strikes sharply increase tensions with Russia as US officials dispute Moscows claim that its aircraft targeted the Islamic State the brutal extremist group that controls much of Syria and Iraq Instead US officials said the strikes appeared to target opponents of Syrias embattled President Bashar alAssad a key Russian ally Those hit include USbacked units that were trained and armed by the CIA officials saidAccusing Russia of pouring gasoline on the fire Defense Secretary Ashton B Carter vowed that US pilots would continue their yearlong bombing campaign against the Islamic State in Syria despite Moscows warning to keep American planes away from its operationsI think what theyre doing is going to backfire and is counterproductive Carter saidThe introduction of Russian air power  which took place with scant notice to the US government  threatens to upend US strategy in Syria at a time when US military officials say they are beginning to discern hints of progress against the Islamic State a heavily armed alQaeda offshoot that is also known as ISIS and ISILIt also raises the stakes over competing visions for Syria outlined this week at the United Nations where Putin insisted that Syrias embattled government is the key to stability after four years of bloodshed and Obama warned that the status quo cannot standThis is Russias air power in SyriaUS officials were particularly irked that they didnt get much warning of the strikes even as they make plans to resume military talks with Russia about Syria as early as next week Discussions have been halted since last year over Russias support for separatists in UkraineEarlier Wednesday a Russian general posted in Baghdad showed up at the US Embassy there officials said and told the American defense attache that airstrikes would begin about an hour laterRussias Defense Ministry said Russian aircraft had conducted about 20 sorties targeting the Islamic State according to the news agency InterfaxThe Syrian staterun news agency reported that Russian planes had attacked dens of the Islamic State in Rastan Talbiseh and other towns around Homs the strategic city that Assad hopes to claim as he seeks to defend areas remaining under his controlBut US officials expressed doubts in the hours after the strikes about Russian claims that the sorties targeted the Islamic State Areas around Homs a former hotbed of the popular revolt that began against Assad in 2011 are not known as strongholds for the group which controls a vast swath of territory across Syria and IraqNidal Ezddin a representative of Homss civil defense force said a series of Russian strikes killed 36 people around Homs These bombings were not against ISIS he said They were for ISISCivil defense officials and activists also reported that some of the Russian strikes were accompanied by barrel bomb attacks by Syrian air force helicoptersThe strikes cap weeks of Russian military buildup in Syria where Assad is battling both the Islamic State and rebel factions backed by the West Assads forces are blamed for fueling the war that has forced more than 4million people to flee the country many of whom are joining a wave of asylum seekers and migrants flooding EuropeForces loyal to Assad hope to lay claim to Homs province a key link between the capital Damascus and government strongholds on the Mediterranean coast including the key port city of Latakia Russia has a naval facility at Tartus about 50 miles south of LatakiaCharles Lister a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center said the strikes may be an attempt to weaken Assads principal adversary rather than the Islamic StateAmid the regimes major losses  Assads apparent request to Moscow for military assistance seems a lastgasp appeal for help from what was a dying regime he said How far Russia is willing to go to defend its proxy interests now remains to be seen but certainly the dynamics of the conflict have taken a huge shift todayRussias strategy in Syria could be work in progressThe strikes appeared to have also hit groups backed by the United States including rebels who have been trained by the CIA A US official said there was no reason to doubt reports from the region that coalitionbacked forces from Hama were hit a reference to a rebel group known as Tajammu alAaza based in that western Syrian provinceThe leader of that group Jamil alSaleh told the news organization AlSourianet that the Russian strikes had pounded his organizations base in Lataminah a town roughly 30 miles north of Homs Saleh was an officer in the Syrian army before defectingThe USbacked group also posted a video that shows fighter jets streaking across the sky seconds before the base is rattled by explosionsGraphic Were Russian airstrikes really aimed at the Islamic State The CIA has trained thousands of fighters at secret bases in Jordan in an effort to bolster moderate factions against the Assad government A Russian strike on USbacked units will only intensify pressure on the Obama administration to respondSpeaking at the United Nations Secretary of State John F Kerry said the United States would have grave concerns if Russian airstrikes hit moderate USbacked opposition forces fighting Assad rather than the Islamic StateAlso on Wednesday Kerry told Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov that the strikes run counter to Russias stated intention to cooperate on deconfliction or ensuring that mishaps do not happen in the airPutin spokesman Dmitry Peskov defended Russias actions after its parliament approved a resolution authorizing the use of force in Syria Russia will factually be the only country to carry out this operation on the legitimate basis of the request of the legitimate government of Syria he saidThe resolution came without warning in the Federation Council Russias higher body of parliament where 162 senators voted unanimously in support after a closeddoor discussion  similar to a vote last year to greenlight Russian military force in UkraineSergei Ivanov the Kremlin chief of staff said that the resolution was strictly limited to the use of Russian aviation in Syria and that ground troops would not be sent into battleWhile Russia has supplied arms to Assad for years direct intervention seemed unlikely until early this month when Russian aircraft tanks and troops were spotted in SyriaSpeaking in Moscow Putin said he hoped Assad would be open to political compromiseI know that President Assad understands that and is ready for such a process We hope that he will be active and flexible and ready to compromise in the name of his country and his people Putin told reporters according to the Reuters news agencyCritics say that the Kremlin is using the Syrian crisis to escape international isolation after its annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in March 2014 and to divert attention at home from the conflict in eastern UkraineThe strikes also come as the Obama administration considers changes to its Syria strategy including a possible expansion of military assistance to antiAssad rebels and a new focus for a troubled effort to train an independent force to fight the Islamic StateMurphy and Ryan reported from Washington Daniela Deane in London Hugh Naylor in Beirut
