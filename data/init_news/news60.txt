Print Ed  How to take the fun out of Halloween As Halloween approaches hairraising yard displays can often cause people to stop gawk and whip out their cellphones Larethia Haddon is well aware of that and is using it to shine some light on reallife horrors rather than typical Halloween themes In her yard at the corner of Mendota and Santa Maria avenues in Detroit there are six dummies portraying police shootings slain children the Flint water crisis and other horrors Last year a single dummy placed facedown in the grass realistically depicting a dead body in her yard shocked passersby and caused fearful calls to the police This time around Haddon wants to inspire a broader range of thought rather than just shock Were trying to do something positive instead of just having a dead body laying in the yard she said Want to get people to be a little more focused on the issues whats going on in the world We need to stick together more We need to come together And if we dont this scene in my yard is going to be reality every single day
