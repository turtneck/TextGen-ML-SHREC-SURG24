The United States shipped hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons to Saudi Arabia just weeks prior to the Saudiled coalitions funeral bombing in Sanaa Yemen according to a new analysis of US government data conducted by Shadowproof The October 8 bombing killed 140 and wounded over 500 It was widely condemned by human rights groups and exposed US support for the Saudiled war in Yemen to greater scrutiny In response to a query from Shadowproof about the funeral strike State Department spokesperson Frankie Sturm replied  We have regularly expressed our concerns to the Saudiled coalition and urged them  as we have urged all sides including the Houthis  to take all feasible measures to mitigate harm to civilians and civilian objects and return to a cessation of hostilities  Despite the US governments purported desire for a cessation of hostilities and concerns for civilians Shadowproofs analysis shows that large quantities of US weapons continue to flow to the Saudi government impeding a sustained ceasefire and enabling civilian carnage In July and August the US shipped Saudi 88 million in bombs 473 million in parts for bombs 313 guided missiles worth 26 million one military helicopter worth 157 million and 334 armored fighting vehicles and 19 armored vehicles which together are worth over 197 million From April to July when peace talks were active the US shipped 50 million in armored vehicles and 82 million in parts for bombs Talks broke down in July and were followed by a major increase in coalition air assaults in Yemen Following the attack on a funeral the US government announced it was  reviewing  its support for the Saudi coalition however as of October 10  there were no changes to US military support for coalition operations A UNbrokered ceasefire implemented in April ushered in a major reduction in fighting Yet US weapons shipments continued In fact over the course of President Barack Obamas administration it has approved a staggering 115 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabiaincluding a 129 billion sale in November 2015 which included over 19000 bombs and a 115 billion sale of tank components ammunition and other weapons The US government has also provided logistical and intelligence support that has facilitated the Saudi coalitions carnage Given Saudis dependence on the US government for military support it is difficult to overstate the degree of influence the US possesses over the Saudi government For example Bruce Riedel a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution said in April If the United States of America and the United Kingdom tonight told King Salman that this war has to end it would end tomorrow Kristine Beckerle who researches Yemen for Human Rights Watch told Shadowproof The Saudiled coalitions air campaign in Yemen has been devastating for civilians hitting marketplaces factories homes and hospitals There is no question US weapons have been used in some of these unlawful attacks including one of the most deadly The US should be suspending arms sales to Saudi until it not only curbs unlawful strikes but also credibly investigates those that have already occurred A survey conducted by the Yemen Data Project found that from the beginning of the Saudi coalitions air campaign in Yemen in March 2015 through August of 2016 more than onethird of the coalitions 8600 strikes hit nonmilitary targets The coalition is responsible for twice as many civilian casualties as all other forces put together virtually all as a result of air strikes UN human rights chief Zeid Raad alHussein said back in March Nasser Arrabyee a journalist in Sanaa told Shadowproof In the first weeks of the war the battle for Sanna was over all the military sites were destroyed yet the coalition strikes continue on a daily basis often hitting civilians The US government continues to insist the Saudi coalition isnt intentionally targeting civilians but Colette Gadenne who heads Mdecins Sans Frontires MSF Yemen mission told Shadowproof Weve seen airstrikes hit civilian locations so often For example there was a strike on a crowded marketplace in Harad at 8 pm on July 4 It took place after people broke their Ramadan fast And we only know about the strikes we see directlyThree MSF hospitals one MSF mobile clinic and an MSF ambulance were attacked by coalition forces After the funeral attack images appeared on social media allegedly showing fragments of a USsupplied tail fin for a JDAM guidance kit for a USmade Mark 82 500 lb bomb Ali AlAhmed an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Institute for Gulf Affairs and himself a Saudi told Shadowproof the Saudis indeed target civilians They couldnt defeat the Houthis on the battlefield so theyre killing women and children bombing schools to get that result Ahmed explained Back in 2010 US Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning disclosed a State Department cable from the same year that showed the US government provided imagery of the Yemen border to the Saudi government despite evidence Saudi aircraft were attacking civilians when attacking Houthis in northern Yemen Assistant Minister of Defense and Aviation Prince Khaled bin Sultan appealed to a US ambassador to give them a Predator drone to help limit civilian casualtiesAnother cable from 2009 that was also disclosed by Manning shows the US government approved military assistance for Saudi Arabia or Yemen if aid was not used against Houthis Since then the US government has allowed the Saudi Kingdom to pull them into an openended war With regard to al Qaida Ahmed noted Hundreds of Saudi jets and their allies bombing Yemeni forces have avoided bombingpositions in Yemen of al QaidaThe Saudi air force is really becoming the air force for alQaida Ahmed said The Saudi bombings have helped mostly one group alQaida Ahmed also stressed the bombings fuel antiAmericanism Prior to the war the Yemeni government cooperated closely with the US in counterterrorism mattersIn a letter to President Obama 36 members of congress urged him to block the 115 billion arms deal announced in August The letter stated Amnesty International has documented at least 33 unlawful airstrikes by the Saudi Arabialed coalition across Yemen that appear to have deliberately targeted civilians and civilians facilities such as hospitals schools markets and places of worship These attacks may amount to war crimesAccording to a recent report by Reuters the coalition has hit sites the US government put on a do not strike list The US designated these locations as being vital infrastructure for delivery of food aid and for postwar reconstructionThe Saudi coalition declared as a target the entire Saada Governorate measuring 4000 square miles which borders Saudi Arabia It also reportedly used incendiary weapons white phosphorous as well as cluster weapons which are banned by most countries Both of these weapons were supplied by the USThe wars effect on civilians in Yemen is enormous The jets overhead scare the children There is no place people can go to be safe even hospitals are hit in strikes The population is traumatized Gadenne saidMore than 10000 civilians have been killed since the Saudiled coalition began including more than 1000 children More than 80 percent of the population now requires some form of humanitarian assistance for survivalBeatriz Ochoa from Save the Children told Shadowproof The number of children that are severely malnourished has doubled to 370000 since the beginning of the coalition bombing 16 million women and children under 5 are suffering from acute malnutrition with over 14 million or roughly half of Yemens population are considered food insecureThe coalition imposed a blockade which has resulted in shortages of medicine and food as well as price spikes and hoarding of goodsRecently there was a reported cholera outbreak which may exacerbate the already dangerous health crisisAnother serious concern is unexploded ordnance A 16yearold girl was collecting firewood in Sadaa and there had been an air strike in the area 3 months prior An unexploded ordnance went off and she lost a leg Gadenne recalledMs Gadenne said MSF has seen victims from unexploded ordnance all over the country Research from Amnesty International found thousands of unexploded munitions in northern Yemen following a 10day tour of the region earlier this year The dire humanitarian crisis resulting from the war has given rise to a great deal of anger in Yemen according to Arrabyee Yemenis see the war as an American war as the coalition couldnt carry out the strikes in Yemen without US support There is a big campaign saying Americans are the ones killing the Yemenis peopleWilliam Hartung from the Center for International Policy told Shadowproof the US is directly involved in Yemen even if its not the one dropping the bombs Without US support theres no way Saudi coalition could wage the war at this level Hartung said The large weapons deals and midflight refueling provided by the US play an important role in Saudis ability to conduct strikes in Yemen The post US Behind Huge Weapons Shipments To Saudi Arabia Prior
