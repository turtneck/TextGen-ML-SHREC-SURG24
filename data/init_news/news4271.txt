It was hosted by CNN and the presentation was so bombastically stupid that it was almost condescending The moderation wasnt great it took far too long to bring up the violence recently perpetrated against journalists and protesters by Trump supporters  and shit you not the Trump campaign itself And absolutely nothing happened thats likely to change an outcome which much like death seems more inevitable every dayBut listen You dont want to hear about the entire debate You either chose to do something else  or worse still you watched it for yourself And as the current patriarch of the heirs of Drumpf said himself Thursday night weve had enough of the debates already So Im going to spare you a playbyplay And Im definitely not going to tell you who won because really why the hell do journalists try to do thatHeres what Ill do instead Im going to focus on the one part of the debate that in the grand scheme of things as best I can tell  which to be clear is very little  matters the most It was early and it was ugly and it was exactly the kind of exhibition of political cynicism and religious bigotry that President Obama calls the source of a lot of destructive acts Im talking about the debate over what Donald Trump said about Muslims all 16 billion of em Wednesday nightThe quote for those of you who were lucky enough to miss that tooI think Islam hates us Theres something there that  theres a tremendous hatred there Theres a tremendous hatred We have to get to the bottom of it Theres an unbelievable hatred of us We have to be very vigilant we have to be very careful and we cant allow people coming into this country who have this hatred of the United States and of people who are not MuslimNeedless to say when a genuflecting Anderson Cooper CNN again offered Trump a chance to at least say he was only referring to those who believed in a radical interpretation of Islam  which is still problematic for someone who wants to be president but whatever  the Donald declined Its very hard to separate radicals from the nearly 16 billion others he answeredAnyway that was the topic on Thursday night But when CNN tossed another softball in Trumps direction and gave him another chance to walk it back are we going to ask him every single day now Trump didnt just reject the offer He went from arguing that it was difficult to tell the difference between a violent jihadist and an 8yearold child to arguing that a lot of them are full of tremendous hatred I will tell you theres something going on that maybe you dont know about maybe a lot of other people dont know about but theres tremendous hatred  And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper I like to solve problems We have a serious serious problem of hate  We have large portions of a group of people  Islam  large portions want to use very very harsh means In response Little Marco offered a tepid critique saying that Trump didnt get that presidents cant just say anything they want Rubio added that he wasnt interested in being politically correct but that there were pragmatic reasons not to dehumanize 16 billion people Thats better I guess but as the Intercepts Murtaza Hussain tweeted Someone should tell these guys Muslims are also watching the debate and hearing them say we should only be nice for utilitarian reasons Why was this the most important moment of the debate Because this wasnt just about Trump though he certainly was the driver It was about the entire Republican Party and about the millions of Americans who continue to support it All over the country  and all over the world  people are watching There are millions of people whose perception of the United States is not set in stone just yet And this is the country we show them I cant blame them if they choose to turn away
