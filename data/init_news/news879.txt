Why Negotiators At Paris Climate Talks Are Tossing The Kyoto ModelNegotiators and heads of state from nearly 200 countries are meeting for the next two weeks near Paris to craft a new treaty to slow global warmingIts the 21st Conference of the Parties held by the United Nations to tackle climate change One treaty emerged in 1997 after the conference in Kyoto Japan Thats no longer in effect and in fact the Kyoto Protocol as its known didnt slow down the gradual warming of the planetNow governments are ever more desperate to do something to slow warming  so much so that theyve thrown out the model set in Kyoto and opted for a new approach for ParisValli Moosa a former climate negotiator from South Africa says the main reason Kyoto failed to slow warming lies largely with who wasnt included in the treaty You actually cannot have a meaningful agreement without China and the United States being part of it he saysThe US Senate refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty so the worlds biggest greenhousegas emitter didnt have skin in the game And developing countries including China and India were not required to reduce emissions Now those countries are becoming the biggest sources of greenhouse gases as their economies thrive China in fact is now the worlds biggest emitter and India isnt far behind Moreover the Kyoto treaty had UN bureaucrats and negotiators setting goals for the participating countries to lower their greenhouse gases Many countries didnt make their targets others dropped out Economies were at stake and few countries were comfortable marching to a UN beatSo what negotiators are bringing to the table at the Paris talks is an arrangement whereby each country is offering to reduce its own emissions by whatever amount it can manage And everybody participates not just developed countriesMost nations arrive with a reduction target already in hand What will be difficult is deciding who will pay how much to developing countries to build economies that wont keep producing high emissionsFrench negotiator Laurence Tubiana points out that the key to success is convincing governments that those economies can be lowcarbon and that this wont be a bar to developing wealth How much Im sacrificing for the sake of emissions reductions thats no more she says of the message that negotiators are pushing And now  the Chinese even the Indians are really coming in Its about lowcarbon economyPrevious attempts to replace the Kyoto treaty have failed This new approach is voluntary and most of the world has agreed theoretically to participate which negotiators hope will sweeten things enough to get a deal Still to be determined however is who will pay for this massive revolution in the worlds energy economy and what strings will be attached to their largesse
