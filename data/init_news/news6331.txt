The P in PBS Should Stand for Plutocratic or Pentagon Posted on Oct 27 2016  WikiMedia  In a television commercial that the Public Broadcasting System PBS ran for years PBS NewsHour host Gwen Ifill declared that she loved her job because it allowed her to ask not only all of my questions but also and more importantly all of your questions  This assertion was and remains absurd just like her networks regular fundraising claim to be free of corporate sponsors The claim has long been contradicted by the string of corporateimage commercials purchased by leading financial defense auto insurance and rail corporations that appear before the networks nightly NewsHour broadcastalong with a list of corporatesponsored foundations and superwealthy individuals who pay for the show along with regular viewers like you Consistent with those commercials and despite its name the news and commentary one finds on PBS is in rich tune with the narrow capitalist parameters of acceptable coverage and debate that typify the more fully and explicitly forprofit and commercialized corporate media As progressive journalist David Sirota suggested two years ago  reflecting on recent investigations showing that supermoneyed rightwing capitalists such as the Koch brothers and Texas billionaire John Arnold had along with more liberal software mogul Bill Gates influenced PBS content through multimilliondollar donations the P in PBS often seems to more properly stand for Plutocratic not Public Advertisement Square Site wide None of this should be surprising to anyone familiar with the distinctively bigbusinessdominated history of US broadcast media  Because the United States fails to provide anything like adequate funding for public broadcasting both PBS and National Public Radio a regular vehicle for neoliberal business ideology depend upon foundations corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for much of their programming Beneath their standard claims to have no interest in shaping public media content these private funders have bottomline agendas meaning that their contributions come with strings attachedstrings that undermine the integrity of the independent journalism they bankroll For what its worth between 1994 and 2014 the NewsHour was primarily owned by the forprofit firm Liberty Media  Liberty Media was run by the conservative and politically active billionaire John Malone who had a majority stake in MacNeilLehrer Productions the shows producer The Pentagon Broadcasting System What might seem more surprising perhaps is the remarkable extent to which the P in PBS often seems to stand for Pentagon or perhaps Presidential when it comes to foreign policy content Whatever the global issue of the day or week NewsHour anchors and their invited experts can be counted on to report and reflect in accord with the doctrinal assumption that Washington always operates with the best of intentions They almost uniformly treat the US as a great benevolent and indispensable force for freedom democracy security peace and order in a dangerous world full of evil and deadly actors The shows invited commentators are drawn primarily from the nations imperial establishment They are commonly current or retired insiders from within the Pentagon the White House the intelligence community andor the nations elite network of foreign policy think tanks the Council on Foreign Relations the granddaddy of all US rulingclass think tanks  the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace the Aspen Institute the Atlantic Council the Rand Corp and the Hoover Institution to name a handful NewsHour anchors and guests generally agree that the United States officially designated enemies are malevolent bad guys who need to be contained controlled and even attacked by the ultimate good guy Uncle Sam Not surprisingly the long and ongoing record of US imperial arrogance and criminality more on that below is swept down George Orwells memory hole even as new entries are added to the ugly registry When reported by the NewsHour horrific crimes committed by the US military are always treated as wellintended mistakes Along with the rest of the mainstream US media the NewsHour insists that Russia deliberately bombs hospitals etc whereas if we do it it is of course an accident  Theres some room for disagreement between and among the shows invited expertsincluding the shows semiloopy foreign policy authority Margaret Warnerabout specific US foreign policy tactics strategies and actions Theres no space for serious debate about the immorality lawlessness or imperial nature of that policy On the rare occasions NewsHour anchors seem to challenge guests from the White House or Pentagon on foreign policy matters it is generally to ask why the US isnt going harder at the officially certified bad guys America as Umpire Not Empire The foreign policy coverage and commentary doesnt get much better in the documentary division of PBS A recent documentary first aired nationally last week shown by PBS bears the risible title American Umpirean obvious World Series season play on what the filmmakers see as the preposterous notion of an American empire It is narrated by exMarine and former NewsHour host and producer Jim Lehrer Developed by the rightwing Hoover Institution and targeted for PBS the organizations own revealing phrase American Umpire takes the doctrinal American exceptionalist USgoodandcivilizedrestofworlddangerousandbad narrative to absurd lengths It provides extensive expert commentary from such former imperial operatives as Madeline Albright the onetime US secretary of state who led the charge to criminally bomb Serbia and who went on CBS 60 Minutes to say that the death of more than half a million Iraqi children killed by Washingtonled economic sanctions was a price worth paying for the advance of US foreign policy goals Condoleezza Rice George W Bushs neoconservative national security adviser before and during the archcriminal US invasion of Iraq Gen Jim Mad Dog Mattis an Iraq invasion commander and a former chief of the US Central Command who two years ago told a San Diego audience that its fun to shoot people George Schultz the Reaganera secretary of state who called the Sandinista government in Nicaragua a cancer in our own land mass that must be cut out and Karl Eikenberry a retired Army lieutenant general who commanded US forces in Afghanistan 10 years ago With further commentary from a handful of mostly conservative academiciansabove all the nationalist Texas AM historian Elizabeth Cobbs  author of a book on which the documentary is based American Umpire portrays 20th and 21st century US foreign policy as nothing more than a noble effort to selflessly provide welcome and fair rules and discipline on the rest of a childish dangerous and reckless planet think Lord of the Flies that lacks the exceptional historical experience bequeathed to US leaders by the nations farseeing Founding Fathers The only substantive criticism of US foreign policy in American Umpire is the complaint voiced by numerous interview subjects that America harms itself to the benefit of others the Europeans above all by taking upon its shoulders too much of the burden of benevolently policing the planet We are just too good for our own good Our Real Task There is not space here to discuss in responsible detail the epic historical deletions and distortions this narrative imposes The omissions are staggering They range from the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos resisting US imperial invasion and occupation at the last centurys outset to the restoration of de facto slavery in Haiti and the Dominican Republic after World War I the unnecessary atom bombing of Hiroshima and even worse of Nagasaki really the first shots of the Cold War  the toppling of more than 50 governments by US coups and invasions since the end of World War II the liquidation of perhaps as many as 5 million Southeast Asians in the socalled Vietnam War between 1962 and 1975 the Cold Warera sponsorship of Third World fascism from Chile to South Africa and Indonesia the attempted assassinations of Fidel Castro and numerous CIAdirected terror bombings in socialist Cuba the near instigation of global thermonuclear war on at least three occasions the development and sponsorship of Osama bin Laden and other radically archreactionary jihadist Muslim paramilitary forces to fight the Cold War against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan the Highway of Death when US warplanes engaged in an aerial traffic jam as they rushed to slaughter tens of thousands of surrendered Iraqi troops retreating from Iraq in 1991 the coordination and sponsorship of a massmurderous civil war on peasants workers and intellectuals with a death toll well into the many hundreds of thousands in Central America during the 1970s and 1980s the disastrous US invasion of Iraq responsible for at least 1 million Iraqi deaths the calamitous US toppling of the Libyan Gadhafi regime the calamitous destabilization of the Syrian regime the US funding and encouragement of civil war in central Africa the enablement and protection of a vicious rightwing coup in Honduras in the spring and summer of 2009 the criminal US global war of terror replete with rampant targeted assassinations torture illegal renditions endless drone war and specialforces killing operations across the Muslim world and other places as well American Umpire hides these horrific transgressions and the imperial calculations behind much of US foreign policy past and present As numerous key US planning documents reveal over and over the goal of that policy was to maintain and if necessary install governments that favored private investment of domestic and foreign capital production for export and the right to bring profits out of the country Given the United States remarkable possession of half the worlds capital after World War II Washington elites had no doubt that US investors and corporations would profit the most Internally the basic selfish national and imperial objectives were openly and candidly discussed As the liberal and dovish imperialist top State Department planner and key Cold War architect George F Kennan explained in Policy Planning Study 23 a critical 1948 document We have about 50 of the worlds wealth but only 63 of its population  In this situation we cannot fail to be the object of envy and resentment Our real task in the coming period is to devise a pattern of relationships which will permit us to maintain this position of disparity  To do so we will have to dispense with all sentimentality and daydreaming  The less we are then hampered by idealistic slogans the better The necessity of dispensing with human rights and other sentimental and unreal objectives was especially pressing in the global south Washington assigned the vast periphery of the world economic capitalist systemAfrica Latin America Southeast Asia and the energyrich and thus strategically hypersignificant Middle Easta less than flattering role It was to fulfill its major function as a source of raw materials and a market  actual State Department language  for the great industrial capitalist nations excluding socialist Russia and its satellites It was to be exploited both for the benefit of US corporationsinvestors and for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan as prosperous US trading and investment partners organized on properly capitalist principles that were hostile to the Soviet bloc Democracy was fine as a slogan and benevolent idealisticsounding mission statement when it came to marketing this core underlying ultraimperialist US policy at home and abroad Because most people in the Third World had no interest in neocolonial subordination and subscribed to what US intelligence officials considered the heretical idea that government has direct responsibility for the welfare of its people what postWorld War II US planners called communism Washingtons reallife commitment to popular governance abroad was strictly qualified to say the least Democracy was suitable to the US as long as its outcomes comported with the interests of US investorscorporations and related US geopolitical objectives It had to be abandoned undermined andor crushed when it threatened those investorscorporations and the broader imperatives of business rule to any significant degree As President Richard Nixons coldblooded National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger explained in June 1970 three years before the US sponsored a fascist coup that overthrew Chiles democratically elected leftist President Salvador Allende I dont see why we need to stand by and watch a country go Communist because of the irresponsibility of its own people The selfish imperial cynicism of US foreign policy continues to this day into the postCold War and post911 era As leading Dutch political scientists Bastiaann van Apeldoorn and Nana de Graaff write in their important new volume  American Grand Strategy and Corporate Elite Networks The Open Door Since the End of the Cold War From the end of the 19th nineteenth century onward American grand strategy has pursued a liberal expansionism aimed at the creation of a global hegemony premised upon open free markets to which global capitaland above all US transnational capitalhas full access  The global Open Door has continued to define the ends of the American grand strategy throughout the postCold War era Becauseas during and beforethe Cold Wars end Washingtons commitment to democracy and human rights is conditional and hypocritical The noble principles are fine insofar as they serve the freemarket hegemony of global and especially US transnational capital They are dispensed with even as US policymakers trumpet them when they do not
