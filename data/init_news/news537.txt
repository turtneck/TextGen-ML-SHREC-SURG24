Anyone writing sentences like nevertheless fuels the perception that the Clintons may have might want to stop and think about whether they are reporting news or innuendoIts Labor Day weekend and the polls have tightened in the last week Donald Trump has done nothing to earn this of course His schizophrenic jaunt from Mexico to ArizonaI love the Mexican people I love them so much Im creating a police force to send them home to Mexicowas a messBecause Hillary Clinton is more unpopular than shes been in a long timeor ever if you believe the spin on the the new Washington PostABC poll In that one shes 15 points underwater Other recent polls have been both better and worseshes minus17 in YouGovEconomist but only minus8 in Fox But the picture is pretty consistent overall and its bleakHer unfavorable numbers over the course of the last several months tell an interesting and mostly overlooked tale The conventional wisdom is that her numbers went south after the Times broke the story in March 2015 of the email server and theyve been lowerhemispheric ever since Thats truebut there are variations within that are worth examiningThrough the summer of 2015 she was barely underwaterthree to five points By December and January it was marginally worse six or seven in most polls But she didnt hit double digits until March and April and then she really bottomed out around minus20 in late May and early JuneWhat was happening Well she and Bernie Sanders were going at it pretty good which surely reduced some liberals opinions of her But mostly she was getting buffeted about on the winds of scandalthe Benghazi committee was leaking a steady trail of morsels and in late May the State Department inspector general came out with its report saying she hadnt gotten White House approval for using the private serverIn other words there looks to be a link between fresh Clinton scandal stories in the newspapers and her approval numbers dropping from a stilllamentablebutmanageable minus8 or 10 to a gulp minus15 or 17 And in the last two weeks of course as weve seen a new batch of such articles her negatives have inched back up and the headtohead polls have tightenedWhat does this tell you to look forward to You dont need the political acumen of Lyndon Johnson to figure this out It means the Republicans and Judicial Watch the source of most of these scandal stories are going to do everything they can to keep them on the front pages between now and Election Day Ohwith assists from Julian Assange and Vladimir PutinThats the only environment in which Trump has a remote chance of winningif it seems like the Clintons are up to their old tricks if there are stories out there that while including no smoking gun nevertheless feed the perception that the Clintons are corruptThe media are showing every sign of falling for each and every breathless Judicial Watch press release that lands in their inboxes without the least bit of skepticism and scrutiny I discussed the weaknesses of that big AP story in my previous column Thereve been other lame stories recently too The Crown Prince of Bahrain one was another preposterous Clinton Rules piece He made his donation to the Clinton Global Initiativewhich wasnt really a donation per se but seed money for a program for Bahraini students to study in Americalong before Clinton became secretary of stateso hed have to have been clairvoyant to know he was going to be corrupting a future secretary four and five years laterMatthew Yglesias cited a few of the whoppers in a strong piece that noted the curious difference in coverage received by the Clinton Foundation and one run by Colin Powell Americas Promise was headed by Alma Powell while Colin was secretary of state in the early 2000s and according to Yglesias got money from disgraced Enron CEO Ken Lay while the State Department was helping Enron resolve a dispute in IndiaWhy the difference in coverage Yes I know a lot of people would say because Colin Powell is clean and the Clintons are corrupt I say the answer is more likely that Colin Powell didnt have a Judicial Watch poking and prodding into every aspect of his life trying to make him look dirty and send him to jail He also didnt face an industry of book authors willing to print the most fantastical lies about him lies gobbled up by hundreds of thousands of readers Go look at the Times nonfiction bestseller list Sit down firstThat insane scrutiny means two things One the media really ought to try to be careful about just swallowing whatever connections and insinuations Judicial Watch and other rightwing Clinton haters trumpet for the next nine weeks Its a rather highstakes time If theres a legit Clinton story obviously run with it But if people find themselves writing sentences with phrases like nevertheless fuels the perception that the Clintons or their associates may have they might want to stop and think about whether what they have on their hands is news or innuendoBut twoyes the scrutiny places responsibility on the Clintons too It may not be fair that they and they alone have a Judicial Watch on their tail But fair or not its a fact And they should behave accordingly And they should know that the right is going to try to keep the words Clinton and scandal next to each other on the front pages for the next nine weeks and they should do everything in their power to keep those words out of the papers Announcing that theyve rethought matters and Chelsea wont remain on the foundation board would be a good start
