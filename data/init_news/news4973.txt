Osteoporosis yes magnesium is more important than calcium for bone health Diabetes Kidney Stones Similarly patients with diagnoses of depression epilepsy diabetes mellitus tremor Parkinsonism arrhythmias circulatory disturbances stroke cardiac infarction arteriosclerosis hypertension migraine cluster headache cramps neurovegetative disorders abdominal pain osteoporosis asthma stress dependent disorders tinnitus ataxia confusion preeclampsia weakness might also be consequences of the magnesium deficiency syndrome  Journal of the American College of Nutrition Amazingly the article referenced above even mentions neurovegetative disorders as a possible result of magnesium deficiency This would include comas Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences can immediately lead to complete depletion of magnesium stores could this be a contributing factor to why we see comas after traumatic accidentsinjuries As I mentioned above magnesium is an electrolyte responsible for brain signals and conductivity Without magnesium people in comas may not be able to come to and resume conductivity Many people with diabetes also fall into diabetic comas Diabetes is listed as another possible consequence of magnesium deficiency Could this be a factor in diabetic comas as well Something to think about and research further Cravings Do you crave chocolate Why when people are stressed out do they go for chocolate Chocolate is one of the highest food sources of magnesium Magnesium is associated with so many disorders that Dr Carolyn Dean of the Nutritional Magnesium Association has devoted an entire book to discussing how she has treated thousands of patients for a wide array of diseases with magnesium as the primary component Her book The Magnesium Miracle is a mustread if you have any of the magnesium deficiency symptoms above or any health problems in general  as there is likely a magnesium component to everything Check out 50 Studies Suggest That Magnesium Deficiency Is Killing Us  Why Dont Doctors Find Magnesium Deficiencies In Tests Unfortunately conventional medicine has not woken up to the amount of research that has been done on magnesium deficiency One of the reasons Western Medicine is so off base with magnesium is how they test it with blood tests Blood tests do not yield ANY information about magnesium  why Because the body controls the levels of blood magnesium very tightly If the magnesium in the blood drops just a little bit youre going to have a heart attack Its that sample So to prevent this the body will rob all of its cells tissues and bones of magnesium in order to keep the blood levels constant If you do a blood test for magnesium the cells could be completely empty while your blood levels remain constant Whats worse is that magnesium is not even in your blood 99 of the magnesium in the body is stored in the cells that get robbed while a mere 1 of your bodys total magnesium is in the blood These tests are a complete waste of time and theyre not educating doctors to this reality Keep Evolving Your Consciousness Inspiration and all our best content straight to your inbox A serum test for magnesium is actually worse than ineffective because a test result that is within normal limits lends a false sense of security about the status of the mineral in the body It also explains why doctors dont recognize magnesium deficiency they assume serum magnesium levels are an accurate measure of all the magnesium in the body  Dr Carolyn Dean The Magnesium Miracle Why Are We So Deficient Heres the shortish version Number one  were being poisoned by our food Number two  were increasingly stressed out Were running our engines on high to keep up with life and its draining us Stress hormone production requires high levels of magnesium and stressful experiences lead to depletion of magnesium stores Number three  were eating more sugar than ever For every molecule of sugar we consume our bodies use 54 molecules of magnesium to process it Fourth  low levels in the soil and modern farming techniques deplete stores of magnesium And lastly magnesium is depleted by many pharmaceutical drugs and estrogen compounds such as oral contraceptives antibiotics cortisone prednisone and blood pressure medications Druginduced nutrient depletion handbook Pelton 2001 Diuretics in coffee and tea caffeine also raise excretion levels Oh and by the way  flouride competes for absorption with magnesium Nowadays nearly everyone is magnesium deficient  no test needed Refinedprocessed foods are stripped of their mineral vitamin and fiber content These are antinutrient foods because they actually steal magnesium in order to be metabolized When consumed they demand that we supplement with magnesium or we are destined to break down eventually due to severe deficiency Like I said sugar is the worst offender Every single molecule of sugar you consume drags over 50 times the amount of magnesium out of your body Well what if you eat a healthy diet Processed products are not the only foods that are devoid of magnesium In general magnesium has been depleted from topsoil diminishing dietary intake across the board while our need for magnesium has increased due to the high levels of toxic exposure we come across in our daily lives air water plastics chemicals the list goes on The soil is depleted of magnesium because of the pesticides that are sprayed on all conventionally grown plants and worldwide pollution that affects even the cleanest fields Pesticides also kill those beneficial bacteriafungi that are necessary in order for plants to convert soil nutrients into plant nutrients usable by humans Are You A Cannabis User Cannabis has so many positive effects in terms of treating diseases such as epilepsy cancer and more read 1  2  3 and cureyourowncancerorg  Trust me Ill be the first to tell you Im all for it  its a safe and effective herb with countless therapeutic benefits that the government has been hiding for years The only way they want you using it is if theyve patented one of its chemical compounds and can sell it to you for a profit However we should also look at what happens to our body on a cellular level if we use cannabis on a daily basis Would you take parasite cleansing herbs every day for the rest of your life or even every few days Probably not Youd take them when youre sick or during a monthly cleanse or else youd develop some side effects from overuse We need to remember that cannabis is a powerful herbal medicine and should be treated in such a way It turns out that using marijuana tends to deplete the bodys stores of magnesium with the result that the person feels more onedge after coming down from the high Of course that doesnt mean that it isnt safe in moderation It means that over time if used consistently without proper balance via magnesium replenishment it can and will cause magnesium deficiency The Best Ways To Get Magnesium 1 Eat magnesium rich foods grown on organic soil 2 Take ionic magnesium drops This is my new favorite method which Ive learned from The Magnesium Miracle 3 Apply magnesium oil to your skin This is the second best way to raise your levels 4 Soak in epsom salt baths  This will provide not only magnesium but sulfur for your liver as well Additional References not linked in
