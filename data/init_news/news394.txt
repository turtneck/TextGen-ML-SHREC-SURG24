Print Some worrisome news is breaking across the nation where most Americans are now preparing to deal with a major spike in their already astronomical healthcare costs The AP is reporting that healthcare premiums are about to rise an average of 25 across the country even as many American families are already struggling to pay their current premiums Premiums will go up sharply next year under President Barack Obamas health care law and many consumers will be down to just one insurer the administration confirmed Monday Thats sure to stoke another Obamacare controversy days before a presidential election Before taxpayerprovided subsidies premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan will increase an average of 25 percent across the 39 states served by the federally run online market according to a report from the Department of Health and Human Services Some states will see much bigger jumps others less Moreover about 1 in 5 consumers will only have plans from a single insurer to pick from after major national carriers such as UnitedHealth Group Humana and Aetna scaled back their roles Consumers will be faced this year with not only big premium increases but also with a declining number of insurers participating and that will lead to a tumultuous open enrollment period said Larry Levitt who tracks the health care law for the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation Fox News took the time on Monday to hammer House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi DCA for her lies that Obamacare would make it easier for most Americans to get healthcare and that it would keep prices more affordable Pelosis definition of affordable seems to be the exact opposite of what it actually means because instead of slowing our rising healthcare costs prices have actually been climbing higher faster  Administration officials are stressing that subsidies provided under the law which are designed to rise alongside premiums will insulate most customers from sticker shock They add that consumers who are willing to switch to cheaper plans will still be able to find bargains Headline rates are generally rising faster than in previous years acknowledged HHS spokesman Kevin Griffis But he added that for most consumers headline rates are not what they pay Senator Ben Sasse RNE wants to hear the Obama administration and their Democrat allies apologize for the disastrous plan because thus far it seems to have hurt the average American far more than its helped Weve reached this point because ObamaCare is built on the lie that Washingtons bureaucrats are smart enough to plan health care for millions of Americans At every turn  whether its COOPs collapsing premiums skyrocketing or big insurers bailing  the American people have paid the price More spin wont solve this  its time for the White House to admit that this law isnt working The people of Arizona woke up to even scarier news on Wednesday when they learned that their premiums would be rising by 116 this year However in Arizona unsubsidized premiums for a hypothetical 27yearold buying a benchmark secondlowest cost silver plan will jump by 116 percent from 196 to 422 according to the administration report Sen John McCain RAriz called the Affordable Care Act a failure Arizona families are demanding affordability accessibility and choice when it comes to their health care  not the expensive restrictive and poor quality care that has been forced upon them by Obamacare McCain said in a statement Until President Obama and Congressional Democrats wake up to the laws failure and until we repeal and replace it with solutions that encourage competition and put patients back in charge the Washingtonknowsbest approach will continue to unfairly burden the Arizona families it was supposed to help Meanwhile it seems that Hillary Clinton hasnt gotten the memo about how bad Obamacare has been or about how much its hurt our economy because shes still out there running victory laps for the abysmal failure You know before it was called Obamacare it was called Hillarycare DemDebate pictwittercomTfalVkgAgO  Hillary Clinton HillaryClinton February 12 2016 Somebody should probably tell her that the majority of Americans hate Obamacare and would prefer seeing it repealed In a summer that saw many insurers drop out of the Affordable Care Acts health insurance exchanges Americans support for the healthcare law continues to be slightly more negative than positive Now 44 of Americans support the law also known as Obamacare and 51 disapprove of it  similar to what Gallup measured last November 51 disapprove of Obamacare or Hillarycare if you prefer even worse about 13 of Americans say the law has actually HURT them and long term most Americans think the law will end up either hurting their families or not making any difference at all Hopefully the Trump campaign is paying attention and will begin hammering away on Obamacare This is a winning issue for Republicans and it could be the issue that helps us win in November Article reposted with permission from Constitutioncom shares
