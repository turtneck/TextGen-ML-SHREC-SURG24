Facebook says users cant stop it from using biometric data   Bloomberg Facebook Incs software knows your face almost as well as your mother does And like mom it isnt asking your permission to do what it wants with old photos While millions of internet users embrace the tagging of family and friends in photos others worried theres something devious afoot are trying to block Facebook as well as Google from amassing such data As advances in facial recognition technology give companies the potential to profit from biometric data privacy advocates see a pattern in how the worlds largest social network and search engine have sold users viewing histories for advertising The companies insist that gathering data on what you look like isnt against the law even without your permission If judges agree with Facebook and Google they may be able to kill off lawsuits filed under a unique Illinois law that carries fines of 1000 to 5000 each time a persons image is used without permission  big enough for a liability headache if claims on behalf of millions of consumers proceed as class actions A loss by the companies could lead to new restrictions on using biometrics in the US similar to those in Europe and Canada
