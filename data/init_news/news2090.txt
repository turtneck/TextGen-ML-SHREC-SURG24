The Democratic National Committee is offering its deep and sincere apology to Bernie Sanders his supporters and the entire party for what it calls the inexcusable remarks made over emailIncoming interim party leader Donna Brazile and six other officials said the emails do not reflect the values of the DNC or our steadfast commitment to neutrality during the nominating processIt wasnt signed by the outgoing DNC head Debbie Wasserman Schultz who announced Monday that she will not gavel in her partys national conventionI have decided that in the interest of making sure that we can start the Democratic convention on a high note that I am not going to gavel in the convention Wasserman Schultz told the Sun Sentinel of Ft Lauderdale according to The Associated PressIn the wake of an email scandal Wasserman Schultz said Sunday that she will resign her post as chairwoman of the DNC after the Democratic National Convention Hillary Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook said it was her decision to step downClinton is all set to accept the Democratic Partys nomination for president She will be the first woman ever to rise to such a positionBut that story is taking a backseat to the controversy brewing inside the Democratic PartyThousands of leaked emails show a supposedly impartial DNC working to secure the nomination for Clinton even trying to paint the Jewish Bernie Sanders as an atheist to voters in the SouthThe scandal comes as no surprise to Sanders supporters who see Clinton as too establishment and cozy with Wall StreetI think the Clinton people stole it The corruption has become more wellknown with the WikiLeaks and such claimed one Sanders supporterMeanwhile Clinton has hired Wasserman Schultz to be a part of her campaign according to Townhallcom The Democratic presidential candidate sent an email to supporters announcing Wasserman Schultz would become the honorary chair of the 50state program to make sure Democrats win at the polls across the countryOpponents of the Florida congresswoman heckled her at a breakfast of state delegates Monday shouting Shame and Youre ruining our democracySupporters of Sanders displayed paper signs that said Emails on one side and Thanks for the help Debbie on the otherWasserman Schultz told the crowd during the uproar that we have to make sure that we move together in a unified wayThe Hillcom reports that allies of Clinton believe Wasserman Schultz should not even stay on as DNC chairwoman during the convention The news outlet says one ally referred to what happened at the Florida breakfast as a reasonIts causing the distraction no one wanted at the convention one Clinton ally said according to The HillWasserman Schultzs resignation after the convention however doesnt mean the end of the disunity problems Liberals unhappy with Clintons vice presidential pick Sen Tim Kaine are looking to cause a stirTheres talk about walking out of the vice presidential or presidential acceptance speech Theres talk about total silence remaining seated turning backs Normon Solomon with the Bernie Delegates Network saidEven with this drama the reality is Clinton will be the nominee She then faces the challenge of reaching out to disgruntled progressives while striking a more moderate tone for the General ElectionIt has been the Democratic Partys history that once the nominee is established and we know who thats going to be and we rally the troops and folks tend to come inside the tent Of course there are those who are not coming in the tent and they were never coming in the tent and thats okay Leah Daughtry CEO of the DNC saidAll eyes will be on Sanders to see what he says to delegates Monday eveningMeanwhile Kaine will be facing the biggest speech of his careerLiberals arent happy hes the vice presidential choice and conservatives think hes too liberal which leads many Democrats to believe hes just rightThe reality about Kaine is that once people know him they tend to like him  even if they disagree with him And hes never lost an electionI am so excited Ive known Tim Kaine for many years and so I know his heart I know his heart and his commitment reflected Alexis Herman former secretary of laborComing off one of the biggest days of his life Sen Kaine walked through his Richmond neighborhood with his wife Anne to Saint Elizabeth Catholic Church Its where the couple has worshipped for three decadesInside Kaine got emotional at times and even sang a solo in the choir Although he has worked to reduce abortions hes come under fire for his support of prochoice policiesBut at the DNC his position is just rightHes a committed Catholic a social justice Catholic He takes that very seriously His work in politics is his outreach Daughtry saidSeveral hundred Democrats followed Kaines example by gathering in Philadelphia at an interfaith service SundayRev James Forbes of the Riverside Church says this week Americans will see a vastly different vision for the futureI would wish that the world gets a chance to see two major options  an option that they remember from people who are angry who are afraid  versus a group thats willing to risk possibilities that could probably do it together but that the prospect of our working together is even brighter Forbes told CBN NewsSo far its been a mixed bag but the week is young
