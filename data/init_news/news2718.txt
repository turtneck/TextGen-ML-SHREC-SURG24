Dispatches from Eric Zuesse This piece is crossposted at strategiccultureorg The power above the US Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI is the US Attorney General and above that person the US President Thats whom the FBI actually serves  not the US public This is the reason why the FBI is having such internal tensions and dissensions over the investigation of Hillary Clinton Not only is she the current Presidents ardently preferred and designated successor  and overwhelmingly supported also by Americas artistocracy and endorsed by the aristocracys press  but the top leadership of the FBI have termsinoffice that unlike for example the term of the US Attorney General do not end with the installation of the next President and these people will therefore be serving quite possibly the very same person whom they are now investigating This is the reason why James Comey the FBIs Director let Clinton totally off the hook on July 5th when he declined to present the case to a grand jury he and the rest of the FBIs top management violated three basic principles of trying whitecollarcrime cases when a prosecutor is serious about wanting to prosecute and obtain a conviction against a person  he and they wanted to keep their jobs not be fighting their boss and their likely future boss Hillary For all intents and purposes above the law If America were an authentic democracy there would be a way for the FBI to serve the public even when the US President doesnt want it to According to the only scientific study that has ever been done of the matter the US federal government is a dictatorship not a democracy This was reluctantly reported by the researchers whose own careers are dependent upon the aristocracy which they were finding actually controls that government They found that the US at the federal level is not a democracy but an oligarchy by which the researchers were referring to an economic elite Americas billionaires and centimillionaires who control Americas international corporations and the charities such as think tanks that are dependent upon them  including many that directly affect US politics such as the think tanks or other waystations for former US government employees to become hired by private firms The authors of the only empirical scientific researchstudy that has been done of whether the United States is a democracy  or instead a dictatorship excluded the very term aristocracy or collective dictatorship such as an economic elite is if that elite actually is in control of the given nations government from their article They did this so as for the meaning not to be clear to the US public In any country in the modern world where an aristocracy exists aristocrats nowadays try to hide their power not like in former eras display their power by crowns and other public symbols of the nobility The closest the studys authors came to using that term aristocracy was their only sentence that employed the pejoritave term for an aristocracy oligarchy That obscure lone sentence was Jeffrey Winters has posited a comparative theory of Oligarchy in which the wealthiest citizens  even in a civil oligarchy like the United States  dominate policy concerning crucial issues of wealth and income protection11  Their 11th footnote made clear that they were referring here to the book Oligarchy  by Jeffrey A Winters which stated the theory that this article had actually just confirmed in the American case Their article mentioned the book  and the oligarchy  only in this one footnote so that the authors of the article whose own careers are dependent upon Americas oligarchs wont be able to be accused by oligarchs or in any way thought by their own financial benefactors  Americas aristocrats to have called the US an oligarchy a collective dictatorship by the few superrich and their agents To apply either term  aristocracy or oligarchy  to ones own country is now viewed as negative an insult to the countrys controlling elite Neither scholars nor scholarly publishers wish to insult the people who ultimately are their top funders  This article was written in the standard unnecessarily obscurantist style of social scientists who want to be comprehensible only to their peers and not to the general public Doing it this way is safer for them because it makes extremely unlikely that their own benefactors would retaliate against them or else against the institutions that hire them by withdrawing their continued financial and promotional support such as by no longer having them invited onto CNN as an expert This type of fear prevents theory in the social sciences from being strictly based upon the given fields empirical findings its not authentically scientific The physical sciences are far less corrupt far more scientific The biological sciences are inbetween  One particular reason why the authors never called the people who control the US government an aristocracy is that everyone knows that the Founders of the US were opposed to  and were engaged in overthrowing the existing aristocracy which happened to be British and that they even banned forever in the US the use of aristocratic titles such as Lord or Sir Consequently within the US the only term that the aristocrats consider acceptable to refer to aristocrats is oligarchs which always refers only to aristocrats in foreign countries  and so is considered safe by the aristocrats writers including scholars and political pundits to use  Everyone knows in accord with the clear intention of Americas Founders  the US should eliminate from its citizenry any aristocrat any selfenclosed and legally immune group that holds power over the government but Americans naturally accept the existence of oligarchs in other countries and goodriddance to them there typically the ones in countries US foreign policy opposes and often overthrows by means of coup or outright military invasion any form of conquest such as in 2003 Iraq or 2011 Libya Its fine to refer to other countries aristocracies as oligarchies because any such foreign aristocracy can therefore be declared to be bad and deserving of overthrow Thus any aristocracy that is opposed to Americas aristocracy especially one thats opposed to being controlled by the US aristocracy and which wants to be controlling instead their own independent nation can acceptably be overthrown by coup such as Ukraine 2014 was or invasion such as Libya 2011 was Thus calling a foreign aristocracy an oligarchy is supportive of not oppposed to the US aristocracy  and so oligarchy is the term the authors used on that one occasion and they never used the prohibited term aristocracy  Nonetheless despite the cultural ban on describing the US as an aristocracy the authors were  as obscurely as they were able  proving that the US is an aristocracy no authentic democracy at all Or again as they said it in their leastobscurantist phrasing of it  Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis even though our findings probably understate the political influence of elites Our measure of the preferences of wealthy or elite Americans  though useful and the best we could generate for a large set of policy cases  is probably less consistent with the relevant preferences than are our measures of the views of ordinary citizens or the alignments of engaged interest groups Yet we found substantial estimated effects even when using this imperfect measure The realworld impact of elites upon public policy may be still greater  Greater than what They didnt say Thats because what they were saying as obscurely as possible is that its probably greater than is shown in the data that was publicly available to them and upon which data their clear finding is that the US is an aristocracy no democracy at all Or as they also put it Economic Elite Domination theories do rather well in our analysis But actually Economic Elite Domination theories virtually all of which come down to positing an aristocracy that consists of the billionaires  and centimillionaires  and their corporations and their think tanks and their lobbyists etc did phenomenally well in their findings not just rather well  they simply cant safely say this Saying it is samizdat in the US dictatorship  They were allowed to prove it but not to say it So thats what they did They didnt want to upset the applecart from which they themselves are feeding  The simplest but no less accurate way of stating their finding is the US at least during the period the researchers probed which was 19812002 was an aristocracy no democracy at all The US in other words was even prior to the infamous Citizens United Supreme Court decision which is making the aristocracy even more concentrated among even fewer people a country of men and women  thats to say of individuals  not of laws its a dictatorship in short it is not a country of laws not of men  Americas Founders have finally lost The country has been taken over by an aristocracy  And one of those men now is actually Hillary Clinton even though she is no longer officially holding governmental power They know she soon might be Thats why the FBI cannot really and seriously  investigate her  Its not for legal reasons at all Its because of whom she is In fact purely on the basis of US laws she clearly ought to be in prison  Any honest lawyer inside or outside the FBI has long known this because the actual case against her is slamdunk  even though the FBI has refused to investigate it and has limited its investigation only to peripheral national security issues The 2 person at FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe right below Director James Comey specified this limitation to his investigators They simply werent allowed to investigate her except on the hardesttoprove crimes that she probably but not definitely did also do The slamdunks were just offlimits to them McCabes wifes political campaign had received 675000 from the PAC of Terry McAuliffe  a close friend of the Clintons who chaired Hillarys 2008 Presidential campaign And even on the hardertoprove matters which FBI Director Comey declined on July 5th to pursue they stood a strong chance of winning if only Comey hadnt prevented their moving forward to try  but those issues are tangential to the basic case against her anyway  There are at least six federal criminal laws which accurately and unquestionably describe even what Ms Clinton has now publicly admitted having done by her privatized email system and intent isnt even mentioned in most of them nor necessary in order for her to be convicted  the actions themselves convict her and the only relevance that intent might have regarding any of these laws would be in determining how long her prison sentence would be  I have already presented the texts of these six laws and you can see the sentences for each one right there and any reader can easily recognize that each one of them describes unambiguously without any doubt what she now admits having done Most of these crimes dont require any intent in order to convict and the ones that do require intent are only knowingly  conceals or else with the intent to impair the objects  use in an official proceeding both of which intents would be easy to prove on the basis of what has already been made public  but others of these laws dont require even that and none of them requires any classified information to have been involved at all  Its just not an issue in these laws Thus conviction under them is far easier If a prosecutor is really seeking to convict someone hell be aiming to get indictments on the easiesttoprove charges first That also presents for the prosecutor the strongest position in the event of an eventual pleabargain As Alan Dershowitz said  commenting on one famous prosecution They also wanted a slamdunk case They wanted the strongest possible case Comey simply didnt he wanted the hardest toconvict case His presentation was a brazen hoax Thats all  Thats the real scandal and nobody other than I has been writing about it as what it is  a hoax But what it shows is that maybe the only way that Clinton will be able to avoid going to prison is by her going to the White House Either she gets a term in the White House or else she gets a much longer term in prison  or else our government is so thoroughly corrupt that she remains free as a private citizen and still above the law even though not serving as a federal official  Even if she is convicted only on these six slamdunk statutes and on none other including not on the ones that Comey was referring to when he said on July 5th that Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case she could be sentenced to a maximum of 73 years in prison 73  5  5  20  20  3  10  10 Adding on others she might also have committed such as the ones that Comey was referring to all of which pertain only to the handling of classified information would mean that her term in prison might be lengthier still but whats important in the email case isnt that its to convict her on essentially theft andor destruction of US government documents by means of transferring them into her private email andor smashing hard drives No one not even a US federal official can legally do that and those six laws are specifically against it  Motive is important in Ms Clintons email case because motive tells us why she was trying to hide from historians and from the public her operations as the US Secretary of State was it because she didnt want them to know that she was selling to the Sauds and her other friends the US State Departments policies in return for their milliondollarplus donations to the Clinton Foundation  and maybe even selling to them andor their cronies US government contracts or why However those are questions regarding other crimes that she might have been perpetrating while in public office not the crimes of her privatized email operation itself and those other crimes whatever they might have been would have been explored only after an indictment on the slamdunks and for further possible prosecutions if President Obamas people were serious about investigating her They werent Clearly this is selective justice Thats the type of justice an aristocracy imposes  Why then did Comey finally switch to reopen the Clinton case It wasnt merely the discovery of some of her previously unknown emails on the computer of Anthony Wiener husband to Hillarys closest aide Huma Abedin As Politico on October 28th reported  Another former Justice official said Comeys letter announcing the reopening of Hillarys case could be part of an effort on his part to quiet internal FBI critics who viewed him as burying the Clinton probe for political reasons Hes come under a lot of criticism from his own people for how hes handled this Hes trying to gain back some of their respect former Justice Department spokeswoman Emily Pierce said His ability to do what he does largely depends on the respect within his own ranks  Joachim Hagopian at Global Research headlined on October 30th The Real Reasons Why FBI Director James Comey Reopened the Hillary Email Investigation  and reported  Former federal attorney for the District of Columbia Joe diGenova spelled it all out in a WMAL radio interview last Friday just hours after the news was released that Comey had sent a letter informing Congress that the case is being reopened DiGenova said that with an open revolt brewing inside the FBI Comey was forced to go public on Friday with reopening the investigation  Finally diGenova dropped one more bombshell in Fridays interview An inside source has revealed to him that the laptops belonging to key Clinton aides Cheryl Mills and Heather Samuelson both wrongly granted immunity  were not destroyed after all as previously reported but have been secretly kept intact by investigating FBI agents refusing to destroy incriminating evidence as part of the inhouse whitewash In other words Comey was between a rock the resignationletters piling up on his desk from subordinates who felt that no person should be above the law and a hard place his ability to stay on at the FBI and not have a scandal against himself bleed out to the public from down below The US wasnt yet that kind of dictatorship  one which could withstand such a public disclosure In order for it to become one the aristocracys control would have needed to be even stronger than it yet is  Also on the 30th Ed Klein in Britains Dail Mail bannered   EXCLUSIVE Resignation letters piling up from disaffected FBI agents his wife urging him to admit he was wrong Why Director Comey jumped at the chance to reopen Hillary investigation James Comey revived the investigation of Clintons email server as he could no longer resist mounting pressure by mutinous agents sources say The atmosphere at the FBI has been toxic ever since Jim Comey announced last July that he wouldnt recommend an indictment against Hillary He told his wife that he was depressed by the stack of resignation letters piling up on his desk from disaffected agents  So does this now mean that finally the FBI will bring before a grand jury the evidence that Hillary Clinton blatantly violated those six federal criminal laws against stealing andor trying to destroy federal documents  There has never  at least since 1981  been so severe a test of the extent to which this nation is as those researchers found it to have unquestionably been between 1981 and 2002 an oligarchy However a serious criminal prosecution of Ms Clinton would potentially start an unwinding of this dictatorship  The present writer will make no prediction However obviously the results of the election on November 8th will certainly have an enormous impact upon the outcome
