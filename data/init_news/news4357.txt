 Truth Is The Enemy Of The State By Bob LivingstonNovember 10 2016  Information Clearing House    Personal Liberty   There is a saw that comes from Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice that the truth will out But not if government has its wayThats because truth is the enemy of the state The state meaning the apparatus of government is the system that controls the American peopleMost people believe they control the political system through elections Little do they know that the government and the corporate state own and control the state and the people In other words the system is rigged as Donald Trump says  The system must keep this information invisible and it does so through constant conditioning of the public mindNow consider what has happened and is happening to Julian Assange Consider Edward SnowdenAssange created WikiLeaks in 2006 exposing among other things malfeasance in the conduct of Bush the Lessers War on Terror Progressive Democrats loved Assange thenBut by 2010 with George W Bush out of power and Barack Obama continuing old wars and starting new ones the truths that were being outed by WikiLeaks were hitting too close to home WikiLeaks got its hands on a treasure trove of State Department and Pentagon emails and documents being dispatched across the globeI wrote at the time in  A war on the truth  that what WikiLeaks was revealing wasthe result of a secretive unaccountable and overpowerful government a perfidious empire that seeks to rule the world by guile cunning or force if necessary And the response by the United States government and by authorities in some of the USs puppet states  like Great Britain which arrested Assange and Sweden which brought spurious charges of rape against him  demonstrate the length the ruling elites will go to suppress the truthTruth is the enemy of a totalitarian regime Fooling lying spying That is the way of the totalitarian regime Fooling lying to and spying on friends and enemies and even worse its own citizensJust before I wrote that we now know Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was contemplating various ways to shut WikiLeaks down During a November meeting sources say Clinton suddenly blurted out Cant we just drone this guyAccording to sources present at the meetingThe statement drew laughter from the room which quickly died off when the Secretary kept talking in a terse manner sources said Clinton said Assange after all was a relatively soft target walking around freely and thumbing his nose without any fear of reprisals from the United States Clinton was upset about Assanges previous 2010 records releases divulging secret US documents about the war in Afghanistan in July and the war in Iraq just a month earlier in October sources said At that time in 2010 Assange was relatively free and not living cloistered in in the embassy of Ecuador in London Prior to 2010 Assange focused Wikileaks efforts on countries outside the United States but now under Clinton and Obama Assange was hammering America with an unparalleled third sweeping Wikileaks document dump in five months Clinton was fuming sources said as each State Department cable dispatched during the Obama administration was signed by herClinton and other top administration officials knew the compromising materials warehoused in the CableGate stash would provide critics and foreign enemies with a treasure trove of counterintelligence Bureaucratic fears about the CableGate release ultimately proved to be well founded by Clinton her inner circle and her boss in the White HouseEfforts to shut down WikiLeaks included an American intelligenceinitiated operation to entrap Assange in a phony rape charge The US government also pressured PayPal VISA and MasterCard to shut down donations to WikiLeaks The Swedish bank handling Assanges legal defense fund was pressured by the US government to freeze the account The firm hosting WikiLeaks website was pressured to shut the site the downNow WikiLeaks is revealing widespread corruption vote rigging media manipulation and other damning evidence against the Democrat Party Hillary Clinton and her minions WikiLeaks and Assange are prying the lid off the propaganda machine and exposing the corrupt systemIn response US intelligence an oxymoron initiated another effort to entrap Assange in a sexrelated scandal this time by connecting him with a phony dating site and alleging he solicited sex with an 8yearold girlJohn Kerrys State Department pressured Ecuador to cut off Assanges internet connection There is a new move afoot to figure a way to pry him out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and turn him over to US authorities where he will no doubt disappear into the bowels of indefinite detentionOnly the power of propaganda keeps the people from overthrowing the US government by force So truth is the enemy of the state and the state will do everything it can to suppress itThats not surprising What is surprising is the vast number of people on both sides of the political spectrum outside of government who see truth seekers and truth disseminators like Assange Snowden and Bradley Manning as enemies rather than friends of liberty
