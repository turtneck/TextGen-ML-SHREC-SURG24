In just the past week hes caused an uproar by blasting the Republican governor of New Mexico  one of the partys most prominent Latinas  while also calling Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas and abruptly parting ways with his recently hired political directorBut there are also signs that hes willing to moderate some of his primary positions and take more conventional steps to prepare for November such as building out a national finance team hiring a pollster accepting checks from wealthy donors and hitting the fundraising circuitCNN interviewed more than a dozen veteran Republican campaign strategists pollsters and past and current officeholders about what Trump needs to do to winTheir consensus He needs to flip blueleaning states to his column soften his public image  particularly as he targets independents women and minority voters  and drive up Hillary Clintons already high negatives even furtherMost said Trump faces an uphill battle in a race that promises to be one of the most divisive and vitriolic in recent memory one in which both Trump and Clinton have historically high unfavorable ratingsYet all agreed on one thing after a primary season that shattered conventional wisdom Dont underestimate Trump A recent Quinnipiac poll found Trump and Clinton in an extremely tight race in several vital swing statesEverything that so many of us have learned by observing politics for the last 30 40 years is going to be challenged this cycle said Ari Fleischer former press secretary to George W Bush Dont be surprised if Donald Trump is sitting in the Oval Office on January 20thHeres a look at the Trump roadmap based on these interviewsTrump must win every state Mitt Romney did in 2012  plus an additional 64 electoral votes In the past few elections Republicans have looked to a handful of battleground states to put them over the top among them Virginia Florida Ohio and ColoradoStill GOP veterans believe the traditional swing states make up a tough lineup for Trump The Republican primaries consistently revealed Trumps weakness with minority and educated voters  vulnerabilities that do not bode well for Trump in an increasingly blue state like VirginiaIf you add up AfricanAmericans Asians and Hispanics in Virginia which are all growing constituencies thats about one third of the electorate said Tucker Martin a Virginia consultant and former aide to exGov Bob McDonnell And then you combine the fact that were a welleducated state  its a very bad match for himHe cant lose the states that Romney won If he starts losing states that Romney won its over said political consultant John Brabender who was a senior strategist to Rick Santorum the former Pennsylvania senator who has endorsed Trump The states that Romney thought were in play  can Trump put them in playAll eyes on the Rust BeltIn other words Trump must redraw the mapThat means targeting states with demographics that favor Trump such as blue collar less educated and older white voters and even competing in states that have consistently leaned blue in recent presidential elections A key part of Trumps strategy is to ensure high turnout of white working class Republican voters But hes also looking to capture a segment of the Democratic base with his populist economic messageI really think he has an opportunity with working class Democrats who we knew years ago as Reagan Democrats said Michigan Republican strategist John Truscott Thats where his unique opportunity is to get some cross overAll of this brings Trump to the Rust BeltFormer Virginia Gov Jim Gilmore who ran for president this cycle and is now calling for the GOP to unite behind Trump said he expects this region to be Trumps gateway to a November victoryIf Donald Trump can hold the South and I think he can and all of a sudden become the spokesman for the disenfranchised working men and working women in the industrialized Midwest suddenly he can be competitive in Ohio Michigan Wisconsin Indiana Minnesota and Pennsylvania Gilmore saidTrump won three of those states  Michigan Indiana and Pennsylvania  during the primariesPennsylvania strategist Mark Harris believes the cards are stacked against Trump in the general election The significance of Trump pulling off a victory in the Keystone State which has not voted for a Republican presidential nominee since 1988 is difficult to overstate he saidPennsylvania Ohio Wisconsin  those sorts of states I think are going to be important to his efforts And certainly probably are friendlier than the Floridas and Colorados of the world said Harris who worked for Marco Rubios super PACTrumps populist economic message has deeply resonated in former industrial states across the Midwest and Northeast  once the center of the countrys manufacturing boomAs part of a broader foreign policy view that promises to put America first Trump regularly laments that the United States has become secondtier next to countries like China and Japan Campaigning in areas where voter frustration and anger about the economy run deep Trump has been relentless in his attacks on international trade agreements and companies that outsource jobsNew Jersey state Sen Mike Doherty one of Trumps earliest political supporters said the key to Trumps success in the Rust Belt will have everything to do with the candidate staying on message on the economyI would continue to focus on the United States has been deindustrialized these international trade agreements have been a disaster and we need to make better deals Doherty said The real issue is the economyAs he stands on the cusp of formally accepting his partys nomination in July Trumps unfavorable ratings are through the roof Trump is determined to make Clinton equally toxic  perhaps the only condition under which he can defeat herBoth of them have such significant vulnerabilities that its just a matter of whether there is a major stumble by either one of them or one campaign better exploits the weaknesses of the other said Peter Ernaut a Nevada GOP strategist These actual campaigns are going to matter a lotIts an ugly matchup that could bring out an unprecedented level of vitriol in the general electionRepublicans believe Clintons high negatives fueled by the widespread perception that she is not honest or trustworthy should be one of Trumps biggest advantages  even as he is widely disliked himselfId make this campaign a race to the bottom said Gregg Keller who has advised Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker I believe the pathway to victory is not in convincing some people to vote but convincing them not to vote at allIn other words Trump needs high turnout from his supporters while discouraging Clinton voters from showing upTrump is already waging full war against ClintonLabeling her Crooked Hillary Trump has hit the former secretary of state on her qualifications pointing to her past support for the Iraq War and her handling of the downfall of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi One scandal thats poised to continue haunting Clinton is her use of a private email server at the State Department particularly after an Inspector General report released last week said she failed to follow proper protocolTrumps attacks have not only targeted Clinton but also her husbandThe episode foreshadowed the bitterly personal feud that is likely to fuel the general electionHillary Clinton has never run against a candidate with ten arms and eight legs like Donald Trump Hes going to be all over her said GOP consultant Alex Castellanos She couldnt figure out how to run against a skinny firstterm US senator named Hussein  much less this political raptor which is what Donald Trump isRepublicans agree that Trumps success so far has largely centered on his aggressive tone and his famous aversion to political correctnessHe needs to double down on being Donald Trump dont try to play to the middle dont try to moderate dont try to be anything that youre not said Keller the Scott Walker adviser You have a brand that is recognizable to tons of people Dont abandon thatBut Republicans also caution that the general election is an entirely different beast Trumps political success has centered on his nontraditional rhetoric and approach to the nations problems But he still may need to find a way to moderate his tone for the broader general election audienceOne of Trumps biggest challenges heading into November is to broaden his appeal and convince nonprimary voters to support him in November That includes winning over independents and even some Democrats and stopping the bleeding with minorities younger voters as well as suburban and moderate Republicans  particularly womenMake the tone a little bit more appealing to everybody  make it a little bit more Grated said veteran pollster and strategist Jim McLaughlin Make it so that that Walmart mom that middle class mom heck that AfricanAmerican mother that Latino mother that is looking for the best for their children will say you know what hes got better ideas than Hillary Clinton doesLanhee Chen a top policy adviser to Romney said Trump must effectively beat back Clintons suggestion that he is an unserious person for a serious time if he wants to broaden his base heading into November A critical part of that Chen said is to get much more serious about policyIt would seem to me that the best way to counteract would be by saying Look Ive got some serious ideas And it doesnt need to be a 200page policy book but it does need to be more than Were going to get tough on China Chen said That would be effective for both for independents but also for conservatives who have questions about what is this guy going to doCORRECTION This story has been updated to reflect that Donald Trump would need to win 64 more electoral votes than Mitt Romney to win the election
