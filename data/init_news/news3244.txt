Trump Ill Only Lose With Cheating Asks Supporters To Watch Polling PlacesPoliticians often urge supporters to get out and vote But Donald Trump wants them to go further Get out and vote and then stake out polling places to watch for cheatingAt a Friday campaign event in Altoona Pa the Republican presidential nominee said voting might not be enough for him to winThe only way we can lose in my opinion  I really mean this  in Pennsylvania is if cheating goes on Trump said We have to call up law enforcement And we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watchingHe wanted the voters themselves to get involved as wellI hope you people can sort of not just vote on the 8th go around and look and watch other polling places and make sure that its 100 percent fine Trump saidThese werent just offthecuff remarks for Trump On his campaign website you can sign up to volunteer to be a Trump election observerCritics have decried his call to voters as voter intimidation which is illegalIf his remarks are found to be voter intimidation and if Trump is deemed an agent of the Republican National Committee it would also violate a consent decree banning the RNC from such activityThat decree which has been in place since 1982 was ordered in response to claims of voter intimidation against minorities in the 1970s and 80s according to Politicos Josh GersteinThe consent decree states that the RNC must refrain from undertaking any ballot security activities in polling places or election districts where the racial or ethnic composition of such districts is a factor in the decision to monitor those areasIt allows normal poll watching like rallying supporters to vote but not anything aimed at voter suppression like posting armed guards at polling locations or questioning people in an intimidating way before they voteIts possible Trump is trying to use this as a fundraising ploy to get peoples names says Richard Hasen a law professor at the University of California Irvine If thats what this is Id be relieved but hes playing with fire hereThe US Supreme Court rejected the RNCs plea to remove the decree in 2013 but added an expiration date of Dec 1 2017 If Trump is violating the decree the DNC could ask for an extension of up to eight years according to HasenTrump spokesman Jason Miller says claims that volunteer poll observers could be a form of voter intimidation are unfoundedTo be clear liberals love to throw out the voter intimidation card What were advocating are open fair and honest elections Miller said in a statement to NPRs Sarah McCammonHe also added that poll watchers are standard for professional campaigns and pointed out poll watcher guides from around the country including New York and TexasIn his statement to NPR Miller echoed Trumps concerns about a rigged systemAs weve seen from Crooked Hillarys willingness to use  and outright lie about  government institutions for personal and political enrichment theres a lot of cheating going on Miller saidIts notable that Trump made these remarks in Pennsylvania Its a key state hell need to win in November but Hillary Clinton has a big lead over Trump there And according to a recent NBC NewsWall Street Journal poll Trump is getting zero percent of the black vote in the statePennsylvania also notably struck down a voter ID law in 2014 a fact that Trump said was shocking in his Friday speechVoter ID laws have long been criticized as a masked strategy to discourage minorities from voting Last month a federal appeals court threw out a voter ID law in North Carolina that as Judge Diana Gribbon Motz wrote targets AfricanAmericans with almost surgical precisionTrumps suggestion that the election will be rigged is one he keeps making even though proven cases of voter fraud are actually very rare As of 2014 a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who has spent years tracking fraud allegations had found only 31 instances of voter fraud out of more than 1 billion votes castIn the absence of a Pennsylvania ID law that might deter certain voters Trumps call to action could be seen as another strategy to deter voters voter intimidationAnd unlike voter fraud voter intimidation has been a problem historically Its what the RNC consent decree is trying to prevent and its not restricted to the GOP During the 2008 election in Philadelphia two members of the New Black Panther Movement were charged with voter intimidation after they stationed themselves outside of polling locations The Department of Justice later dropped the case which led to criticism that the Obama administration was unwilling to prosecute the black men for civil rights violations
