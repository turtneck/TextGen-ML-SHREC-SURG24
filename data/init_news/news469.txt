This was not a subject that was on anybodys mind until I brought it up at my announcementNot on anyones mind For years immigration has been the subject of nearconstant often bitter argument within the GOP But it is true that Trump has brought the debate to a new place  first with his announcement speech about whether Mexican migrants are really rapists and now with the somewhat more nuanced Trump planMuch of it  visa tracking EVerify withholding funds from sanctuary cities  predates Trump Even building the Great Wall is not particularly new I for one have been advocating that in this space since 2006 Dominating the discussion however are his two policy innovations a abolition of birthright citizenship and b mass deportationIf you are born in the United States you are an American citizen So says the 14th Amendment Barring some esoteric and radically new jurisprudence abolition would require amending the Constitution Which would take years and great political effort And make the GOP anathema to Hispanic Americans for a generationAnd for what Birthright citizenship is a symptom not a cause If you regain control of the border the number of birthright babies fades to insignificance The time and energy it would take to amend the Constitution are far more usefully deployed securing the borderMoreover the real issue is not the birthright babies themselves but the chain migration that follows It turns one baby into an imported villageChain migration however is not a constitutional right Its a result of statutes and regulations These can be readily changed That should be the focus not a quixotic constitutional battleLast Sunday Trump told NBCs Chuck Todd that all illegal immigrants must leave the country Although once theyve been kicked out we will let the good ones back inOn its own terms this is crackpot Wouldnt you save a lot just on Mayflower moving costs if you chose the good ones first  before sending SWAT teams to turf families out of their homes loading them on buses and dumping them on the other side of the Rio GrandeLess frivolously it is estimated by the conservative American Action Forum that mass deportation would take about 20 years and cost about 500billion for all the police judges lawyers and enforcement agents  and bus drivers  needed to expel 11million peopleThis would all be merely ridiculous if it werent morally obscene Forcibly evict 11million people from their homes It cant happen It shouldnt happen And of course it wont ever happen But because its the view of the Republican frontrunner every other candidate is now required to react So instead of debating border security guestworker programs and sanctuary cities  where Republicans are on firm moral and political ground  they are forced into a debate about a repulsive fantasyWhich for the Republican Party is also political poison Mitt Romney lost the Hispanic vote by 44points and he was advocating only selfdeportation Now the party is discussing forced deportationIt is not just Hispanics who will be alienated Romney lost the Asian vote too By 47 points And many nonminorities will be offended by the idea of rounding up 11million people the vast majority of whom are lawabiding members of their communitiesDonald Trump has every right to advance his ideas He is not to be begrudged his masterly showmanship his relentless candor or his polling success I strongly oppose the idea of ostracizing anyone from the GOP or the conservative movement On whose authority Let the people decideBut that is not to say that he should be exempt from normal scrutiny or from consideration of the effect of his candidacy on conservatisms future If you are a conservative alarmed at the countrys direction and committed to retaking the White House you should be concerned about what Trumps ascendancy is doing to the chances of that happeningThe Democrats presumptive candidate is flailing badly Republicans have an unusually talented field with a good chance of winning back the presidency Do they really want to be dragged into the swamps  right now on immigration  that will make that prospect electorally impossibleYes I understand The anger the frustration etc etc that Trump is channeling But how are these alleviated by yelling Im mad as hell  and proceeding to elect Hillary ClintonRead more from Charles Krauthammers archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
