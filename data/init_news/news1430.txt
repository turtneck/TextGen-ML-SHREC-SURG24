The teacher thought Feliz Diaz like those other immigrants from the wrong side of the tracks was weak and afraid Someone learned a lesson that dayFelix Diaz grew up on the wrong side of the Union Pacific railroad tracks in the town of Victorville California Victorville is in the Mojave Desert 100 miles or so from Los Angeles His fatherPorfirioworked in the cement plant and Carmen his mother sewed the familys clothes Felix was the youngest of four brothers and the smallest the last in line The shirts he wore to school were handmedowns made of cement sacksThe parents were in the US illegally and every move they made most of their adult lives was weighed against the chance of being discovered and deported The school was called Eva Dell Elementary and Felixs thirdgrade teacherMiss Appleberrywas 40 or so but new to teaching unsure of herself around kids unsure of herself around Mexicans and maybe because of that or partly because of that she yelled a lot Maybe she was just a natural yeller Here is how Felix remembers itAt work then as now is the prevalent idea that anyone who doesnt speak fluent American is at least a little slow This idea was part of Miss Appleberrys thinking even though most of the students in her class were growing up in homes where little English was spoken Miss Appleberry in turn spoke no Spanish Felix Diazwho turns 82 this Julyremembers this like last weekNot to make excuses because there are none for this but teaching kids who do not speak English requires patienceropeand Miss Appleberry came to the end of hers early Not far into the school year she brought out a paddle and announced a spelling test Im sick of you Mexicans not spelling properly she saidLike everybody else Mr Riles walked to work He smoked two cigarettes on the way there every afternoon The first one he lighted as he left his house He walked halfway to the plant lit his second cigarette off the first one and dropped the butt on the ground Felix collected Mr Riles butts and made cigarettes of his own And it was from those cigarettes he got tuberculosisThe Mexicansand the much smaller number of blacks in townshared a single ward for TB patients Felix Diaz remembers that just hours before a tubercular patient died the nurses would say Hes hemorrhaging and put up a screen to hide the spray of blood coming up out of the dying mans mouth That was the way Mr Riles died and the way Felix expected to die too No one ever took the few minutes to explain to him what was going on and when a doctor and a nurse came in one morning and told him they were all set to take out his tonsils that afternoon Felix who didnt know what tonsils were thought the operating room was where they took you to dieAnd so the morning we were talking about he sat at his desk as Miss Appleberry announced each students scores and took them one at a time into the hallway closed the door and hit them with her paddle Boys and girls alike Felix remembers the flooring in the hallway was all wood and the sounds of the paddle followed by the sounds of the 7 or 8yearolds crying out echoed clearly in the room Thirtyfive kids sitting in terror or painFelix shook his head no Everyone else had gone with the teacherand it is worth mentioning here that to this day teachers are held in higher regard in Latin cultures than they are in others They are often called maestro or maestrarevered almost like priestsMiss Appleberry began to scream and in seconds whatever sweet authoritarian revenge she was enjoying in the hallway disappeared She grabbed him trying to jerk him out of his desk But the desks in those days were attached to the chairs and the chairs were bolted to the floor and Felix and his desk did not move Miss Appleberry shook him still screaming her hard narrow face balled up like a fist but he would not let go She had long fingernails and she scratched his arms and they bled But he clung to the chairAnd unlike the parking lot at a Trump rally in the end there was a compromise She let go of the paddle he let go of the desk and Miss Appleberry dragged him down the hall to the school principal Mr Mullen Eva Dell Elementary did not have much money and the principal had to teach a class of his own too Miss Appleberry brought Felix into his classroom and announced hed refused to take his punishmentIt was not over though His arm was scabbing where it had bled and he knew his father would want to know what happened He took his friend Leo along knowing that his father would never take his word against a teachers As mentioned teachers were almost like priestsThe principal recognized Felixs fathermaybe from the arrangements theyd made while Felix was in the hospitaland begged him to intercede with the crowd To explain for him that he understood what happened and promised they would never see Miss Appleberry again And good to his word in the morning she was gone and nobody at Eva Dell Elementary ever saw her again Even Felix Diaz does not know what happened to her afterwardThat was Southern California 1942 and this is the repeating lesson of American history Which is this Dismissing people wholesale might give you free reign to bring out the paddle but it doesnt mean that some of those people wont cling to the chair
