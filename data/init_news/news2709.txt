Sex Bombshell Exposed After Hillary Couldnt Hide What She Did Back In 2011 Posted on October 31 2016 by Robert Rich in Politics Share This Hillary Clinton is backpedaling these days but her past isnt making things any easier on her In fact it seems that her dirty deeds from 2011 just came to the surface in the form of a sex bombshell  and not even she could hide it forever With the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillarys emails and private server on account of another case into Anthony Weiners sexting of an alleged minor it seems that there are some startling details coming forward Although we all know that Weiner is a longtime pervert and sexual predator it looks like things have been going on for longer than we thought  and Hillary knew about it all along Everyone who knew Anthony Weiner targeted underage girls back in 2011 John Podesta Neera Tanden and Hillary Clinton left and Jennifer Palmieri right According to Mail Online  Hillarys camp knew that Weiner was talking to and sending sexually graphic images to an underage girl all the way back in 2011 yet they did nothing to stop him In fact Jennifer Palmieri the campaign communications director in 2011 sent an email to John Podesta now chair of Clintons presidential campaign and Neera Tanden another Clinton adviser detailing Weiners predatory and criminal behavior Married to Hillarys current top aide Huma Abedin at the time Weiners indiscretions were made public knowledge to Hillarys camp and only met with a mere oof from Podesta Further reports indicate that police were sent to the 17yearold girls home at the time to interview both the child and her parents Anthony Weiner and his sex pics Of course as we all know now Weiner has come under official investigation after sending lewd messages to a different 15yearold girl more recently However one can only wonder if Weiners most recent victim could have been spared if his predatory behavior was addressed back in 2011 rather than swept under the rug Although hes been widely deemed the black sheep of the political realm it certainly appears that his divorce and early resignation was the least of concern pertaining to the fallout of his behavior Seeing how the most recent of Weiners consequences just slapped Hillary it doesnt take much to imagine the hell hes living in right now Anthony Weiner and steamy messages he sent to a woman other than his wife However it is good to have these things out in the open as it helps show the true Hillary Clinton  the one she never wanted you to know about Theres no question that Hillary would do whatever it took to remain in power but this is just ridiculous Because of her neglect and the blind eye turned by her staff an underage girl was allowed to be victimized because the truth would have a negative effect on them There really is no jail cell thats suited for what Hillary deserves but she will most certainly have to answer for her misdeeds after shes dead and gone from this earth  and suffering for an eternity sounds rather fitting for the vile things shes done
