The banner headline on the Drudge Report the morning after Wednesdays presidential forum screamed HILLARY AND THE EAR PEARL The story it linked to was from Infowarscom the website of radio host Alex Jones a crazy person who believes the government has a special tornado weaponand used it to attack Oklahoma in 2013 Citing a tweet from actor and rightwing troll James Woods Infowars wondered if Clinton had beenwearing an earpiece during last nights presidential forum as indicated by pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of fleshcolored device embedded inside her earSo was it a fleshcolored earpiece as Infowars insistedOr was it a pearlcolored earpiece as Drudge claimed No one can say but the ad hoc investigative group of conspiracy theorists and crackpot celebrities seems pretty convinced that Hillary Clinton had someone secretly feeding answers into her ear during the forum The evidence was convincing enough that Donald Trumps son  the elephantbutchering one not the offBroadway American Psychoone  tweeted out a link to the Infowars storySo congratulations everyone weve officially reached the Presidential Candidate Cheats Via Secret Radio Technology stage of the 2016 election Its arrived a bit early this year but this conspiratorial story line has become a recurring fixture of presidential campaigns thanks to the internets inexhaustible capacity to prey on gullibility and partisan reflexesThe secret earpiece story made its first big splash in the latter stages of the 2004 presidential election when blogger Joseph Cannon noticed an odd bulge in the back of George W Bushs suit jacket during an early October debate Bush seemed to have a wire or an odd protrusion of some sort running down his back Cannon wrote Apparently Fearless Leader used an earpiece during the confrontationThe speculative accusation might have remained confined to the liberal blogosphere had it not been for the efforts of the website youre reading at this moment Saloncom which published halfskeptical writeups of the circumstantial evidence surrounding the Bush wire and contacted NASA scientists for image analysis of the Bush bulge From Salon the story jumped to The Washington Post and The New York Times which managed to obtain derisive denials from Bush campaign staffers The bulge even became the centerpiece of a David Letterman riff Fervent speculation aside no direct evidence was ever produced indicating that Bush was wired during his debate with John Kerry After Bush won reelection a month later the issue receded back into the shaded corners of the internetAlmost exactly four years later as a young Democratic senator from Illinois took to the debate stage it was the conservative blogosphere that found itself on secret earpiece patrol During the Oct 7 2008 presidential debate blogger Ann Althouse wrote that she had noticed that Obama was wearing an earpiece and posted a photo of the alleged device in Barack Obamas ear She quickly reconsidered her analysis and recognized that she was looking at light reflecting off Obamas ear but left open the possibility that a secret earpiece might still exist Just because the thing I saw wasnt there doesnt mean there wasnt something there that I didnt seeThe 2012 election was largely free of any prominent earpiece speculation though some chain emails bouncedaroundaccusingObama of wearing an earpiece and having a suspicious Bushlike suit bulge That cycles primary example of overwrought hes a cheater attacks were directed at Republican contender Mitt Romney whom liberal bloggers accused of consulting crib notes during the first debate with Obama Romney was actually holding a handkerchief The relative lack of earpiece mania in 2012 has been more than compensated for in 2016 with this ridiculous story about Hillary Clintons clandestine listening device featured prominently on one of the worlds most heavily trafficked political websites and endorsed by the son of the Republican nominee Other Clintonrelated conspiracies have proved to be remarkably persistent this cycle her allegedly failing health being the most prominent among them So theres an excellent chance that this one will stick around too The question that arises from all this is why the earpiece phenomenon keeps popping up election after election in defiance of consistent debunking and a lack of evidence to support the allegations These sorts of beliefs are dependent on if you have a conspiracy worldview and then on your partisanship said Joseph Uscinski a professor of political science at the University of Miami whos written extensively about political conspiracy theories People point fingers at the other side Basically if youre already predisposed to believe that acandidate from the other party is going to cheat then youre more likely to take at face value an allegation that he or shecheated during a debate When someone presents you with grainy screen captures of George W Bush or Hillary Clinton and claims that they show telecommunications equipment hidden on their bodies your partisanship enables you to bridge the sizable gap between the poor evidence and the firm conclusion that someone offstage was whispering into the candidates ear These cheating allegations tend to take the form of a secret earpiece simply because thats really the only way someone participating in a nationally televised presidential debate could conceivably cheat Its just like when Hillary Clinton goes on Jimmy Kimmel Live and opens the pickle jar Uscinski explained referring to a humorousfeat of strength that Clinton performed tomock questions about her health and thatconspiratorial conservatives claimed was rigged The only way she could have cheated in that test   was to have a preopened pickle jar Its sort of obvious that if people are going to be predisposed to thinking that cheating was taking place that would be the method in which it would be done I dont know whether Matt Drudge and Donald Trump Jr actually believe that Clinton was wired up during this weeks president forum but theyre nonetheless legitimizing that idea in the minds of people who are already apt to believe it
