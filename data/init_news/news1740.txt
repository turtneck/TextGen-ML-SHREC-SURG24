A study conducted at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Queensland Australia has recently shed new light on what could become the next big cancer treatment the blushwood berry Via AlternativeNews This naturally occurring fruit contains compounds that began killing off cancer cells almost immediately when studied in the laboratory The Guardian Reports Scientists have managed to destroy cancerous tumors by using an experimental drug derived from the seeds of a fruit found in north Queensland rainforestsThe drug called EBC46 was produced by extracting a compound from the berry of the blushwood tree a plant only found in specific areas of the Atherton Tablelands A single injection of the drug directly into melanoma models in the laboratory as well as into cancers of the head neck and colon in animals destroyed the tumours longterm in more than 70 of cases the studys lead author Dr Glen Boyle saidIn preclinical trials we injected it into our models and within five minutes you see a purpling of the area that looks like a bruise Boyle from the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute saidAbout 24 hours later the tumour area goes black a couple of days later you see a scab and at around the 15 week mark the scab falls off leaving clean skin with no tumour there The speed certainly surprised meResearchers believe the drug triggers a cellular response which cuts off the blood supply to the tumor by opening it up Thats why we see a bruiselike situation forming in the tumour Boyle said This seems to lead to an activation of the bodys own immune system which then comes in and cleans up the messIt has been used by veterinarians in about 300 cases of cancer in companion animals including dogs cats and horses There was no evidence EBC46 would be effective to treat cancers that had spread to other parts of the body known as metastatic cancers Boyle saidThe drug is being developed as a human and veterinary pharmaceutical through QBiotics a subsidiary of the company which discovered the drug called EcoBiotics The company is also examining the potential for a blushwood plantation Ethical approval was recently granted for phase 1 human clinical trials but even if those proved successful it was unlikely the drug would replace conventional chemotherapy treatment Boyle saidChemotherapy is still used because it is very effective for a lot of people he said But EBC46 could perhaps be used in people who for some reason chemotherapy doesnt work for or for elderly patients whose body cant sustain another round of chemotherapy treatment The preclinical trial was funded by QIMR Berghofer and the National Health and Medical Research Council and the results were published in the journal PLOS OneHealthy  Natural World Reports Blushwood Berries  Where they Come From Blushwood berries are the fruit of the blushwood tree which is known to grow in only one region of the world the rainforests of Far North Queensland Australia These tropical trees are not found anywhere else on the globe but grow in abundance near Australias northeastern tipThese particular trees need very niche conditions to thriveconditions which can only be found in specific portions of Far North Queensland Australia Considering their usefulness as proven by the latest cancer research published in PLOS One  some are wondering if they could be grown in a greenhouse environment so that people all over the world could benefit from their cancerkilling propertiesBlushwood Berries  What kind of Cancer they Eradicate The researchers at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute headed by Dr Glen Boyle used an experimental drug produced from the seeds of blushwood berries called EBC46 They used this drug to treat spots of melanoma the most deadly form of skin cancer on dogs cats and horsesThe subjects were diagnosed by veterinarians and given a poor prognosis most being considered candidates for euthanasia prior to participating in the study Amazingly these animals that had been on deaths door prior to the study had their melanoma tumors disappear after treatment in the lab by Dr Boyle and his team of scientistsTumors were Gone within 48 Hours When the EBC46 was injected into the cancerous cells on the subjects the tumors reacted by turning a dark color then falling off The derivative from the blushwood berry is thought to cut off oxygen supply to the cancer cells allowing for the removal of tumors without the need for surgery chemotherapy or radiation therapyThe researchers reported that most of the subjects tumorspreviously considered a lost cause by veterinarianswere gone within 48 hours of being injected with EBC46 Under the microscope the individual cancer cells began shriveling up and dying within mere moments of coming into contact with the EBC46
