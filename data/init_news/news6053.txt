Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully argued against a nuclear deal with Iran telling a joint meeting of Congress on Tuesday that such an agreement would have the opposite effect of what the international community intends because it would effectively supply Iran with the means to produce a nuclear weaponThe agreement being negotiated doesnt block Irans path to the bomb it paves Irans path to the bomb Netanyahu said So why would anyone make this dealNetanyahus speech generated a swirl of controversy before it was even delivered and laid bare fissures between the prime minister and the Obama administration Netanyahu used the address to paint Iran as a sponsor of terrorism that is aggressively marching across the Middle East and would exploit a deal to satisfy its own nuclear ambitionsNetanyahu said the countrys tentacles of terror pose a grave threat toIsrael and the world The prime minister expressed his concernsabout enriched uranium and Iranian nuclear research and development as well as his worries about the approach taken to the international nuclear talksThis is a bad deal A very bad deal We are better off without it he said Why should Irans radical regime change for the better when it can enjoy the best of both worlds Aggression abroad prosperity at homeHe was greeted with raucous applause in the House chamber and was interrupted numerous times by standing ovationsWe must all stand together to stop Irans march of conquest subjugation and terror he said asserting that Iranand the Islamic State are competing for the crown of militant IslamThe complete transcript of Netanyahus address to CongressMeanwhile Secretary of State John F Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif were talking in Geneva on Tuesday ahead of a March 24 deadline on the framework for a nuclear dealSpeaking in the Oval Office President Obama said Netanyahu didnt offer any viable alternatives to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon Obama was on a teleconference call on Ukraine and other issues with other world leaders including British Prime Minister David Cameron and did not watch the speechI did have a chance to take a look at the transcript and as far as I can tell there was nothing new he saidThe central question is how can we stop them from getting a nuclear weapon Obama saidA senior US official said that simply demanding that Iran completely capitulate is not a plan and would not garner international supportThis person said the United States has been using and continues to use the pressure of sanctions to try to achieve a deal and it does not trust the Iranian regime The negotiations are insisting on transparency and are not an opening to a rapprochement with Iran this person said and their clear objective has been to prevent Iran from acquiring a weaponThe logic of the prime ministers speech is regime change not a nuclear speech this person saidNetanyahu said a deal would only whet Irans appetite for more nuclear material He evoked Hemingway asserting that a deal would be a farewell to arms control andsaid it would cause the Middle East to be crisscrossed by nuclear trip wires Hedeployedaphysics lessonon uranium and centrifuges to help make his case  one the administration said was short on specificsThe prime minister spoke of the Jewish holiday of Purim which begins Wednesday night It celebrates the Jewish Book of Esther which describes a highranking member of the Persian empire plotting to kill Jews  a plot foiled by Queen Esther who is JewishToday the Jewish people face another attempt by yet another Persian potentate to destroy us Netanyahu saidHow to tie Moses Game of Thrones and Iran together in one speechNetanyahu praised Obama publicly attempting topaperover some of the tensions that erupted between the Israeli government and the administration since the speech was announced in January The temperaturereached a boiling point last week Netanyahu also thanked Congress for approving money for Israels Iron Dome missile defense systemWe appreciate all that President Obama has done for Israel Netanyahu said to applause Some of what the president has done he said isnt known publicly but is known to NetanyahuI know that my speech has been the subject of much controversy I deeply regret that some perceive my being here as political That was never my intention Netanyahu said He thanked Democrats and Republicans for their support for Israel The relationship between the two countries he said has always been above politics and must always remain above politicsHouse Speaker John A Boehner ROhioinvitedNetanyahu to speak without consulting the White House in advance critics have described his decision as abreachof protocol Obama said he would not meet with the prime minister because the visit comes too close to the Israeli elections on March 17 There is bipartisanlegislationbefore Congress that would impose additional sanctions on Iran Obama has said he would veto the bill because it would undermine the talks with IranBoehner said in a statement that the speech was one thatthe American people needed to hear plain and simple It addressed the gravity of the threats we face and why we cannot allow a nuclear Iran or any semblance of a path to a nuclear IranThe Netanyahu speech wasextraordinary both for the content and the controversy which it has generated Last week national security adviser Susan E Rice said the speech would be destructive to USIsraeli relations and inject partisanship into their association She and Obama tried to turn down the temperature Monday Obama saidit was a distraction that would not permanently undermine relationsNetanyahus political future is at stake He faces a potentially difficult reelection to an unprecedented fourth term on March 17 The speech was delayed by five minutes in Israel where it ran in the evening so that the countrys electoral monitors could screen it for illegal campaigningHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif who left the chamber as Netanyahu was saying goodbyes said in a statement she was saddened by the insult to the intelligence of the United States as part of the P5 1 nations and saddened by the condescension toward our knowledge of the threat posed by Iran and our broader commitment to preventing nuclear proliferationMost who did not show up cited a combination of factors including a reticence to participate in what they described as the politicization of the USIsrael relationship and as a protest to the perceived affront of inviting a foreign leader without conferring with ObamaRep Gerald E Connolly DVa who faced pressure from Israel supporters after he said he was undecided on attending said he anguished over the decision but finally came to the conclusion that I can go without compromising any principleThe USIsrael relationshipsupercedes this prime minister and his behavior Connolly saidI cherish and value that relationshipandwant tomake astatement about thatWith nearly a quarter of the232 congressional Democrats saying they would skip the speech someRepublicans seized on the division On Monday Sen Lindsey O Graham RSC called the noshowspetty and immatureI think its a mistake for a member of Congress to miss a speech of this importance Graham said The politics of the moment pale in comparison to the longterm consequences of a bad deal with IranObama and Rice gave a glimpse Monday of what a potential nuclear deal could look like Obama said in an interview with Reuters that the United States is prepared to agree if Iran is willing to agree to doubledigit years of keeping their nuclear program where it is right now and in fact rolling back elements of it that currently exist If weve got that and weve got a way of verifying that theres no other steps we can take that would give us such assurance that they dont have a nuclear weaponAlthough rarely mentioned anothercomplication in the nuclear talks is Israels own undeclared  but widely assumed  nuclear program and its snub of the nuclear NonProliferation Treaty or NPT which oversees the spread of nuclear technology around the world Iran has repeatedly accused the West of applying what it calls a double standard on nuclear issues  a clear reference to Israel Iran is a signatory of the NPT Israel is notPublicly Israel neither confirms nor denies that it has nuclear weapons But many experts in nuclear arms believe that Israel has extensive capabilities In 1986 Mordechai Vanunu a disgruntled Israeli technician at a suspected nuclear facility leaked photos to a British newspaper that led foreign experts to conclude that Israel had a large nuclear arsenal Israeli intelligence agents later arrested Vanunu in RomeObama said the goal is to ensure there is a yearlong lag between any potential decision by Iran to build a nuclear weapon and when it can actually produce oneNetanyahu said the position doesnt go far enoughNo country has a greater stake  no country has a greater stake than Israel in a good deal that peacefully removes this threat Netanyahu said
