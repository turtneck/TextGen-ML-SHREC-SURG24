Theres been a lot of media attention recently to the changing demographics of the United States where at current rates people who identify as whiteare expected to become a minority by the year 2050 But in many ways the shift in national demographics has been accelerated beyond even thatNew data from the American Values Atlas showsthat while white people continue to be the majority in allbut 4 states in the country white Christians are the minority in a whopping 19 states And nationwide Americans who identify as Protestant are now in the minority for the first time everclocking in at a mere 47 percent of Americansand fallingThe most obvious reason for this change is growing racial diversity Most Americans still identify as Christian but Christian is a group that is less white and less Protestant than it has been at any time in history The massive growth in Hispanic Catholics in particular has been a major factor in this shift in the ethnic and religious identity of this country White Catholics used to outnumber Hispanic Catholics 3 to 1 in the 2000s but now its only by a 2 to 1 marginBut another major reason religious diversity is outpacing the growth of racialethnic diversity is largely due to the explosive growth in nonbelief among Americans One in five Americans now identifies as religiously unaffiliated In 13 states the nones are the largest religious group Nonreligious people now equal Catholics in number and their proportion is likely to grow dramatically as young people are by far the most nonreligious group in the country This isnt some kind of side effect of their youth eitherAs Adam Lee has noted the millennial generation is becoming less religious as they ageThese changes explain the modern political landscape as well as any economic indicator While not all white Christians are conservative these changing numbers definitely suggest that conservative Christians are rapidly losing their grip on power And while some nonwhite Christians are conservative their numbers are not making up for what the Christian right is losing And whether conservative leaders are aware of the exact numbers or not its clear that they sense that change is in the air Just by speaking to young people turning on your TV or reading the Internet you can sense the waythe country is lurching awayfrom conservative Christian values and towards a more liberal secular outlook And conservative Christians arent taking these changes well at allTo look at the Christian right now is to see a people who know they are losing power and are desperately trying to reassert dominance before its lost altogether The most obvious example of this is the frenzy of antiabortion activity in recent years Antichoice forces have controlled the Republican Party since the late 70s but only in the past few years have they concentrated so singlemindedly on trying to destroy legal abortion in wide swaths of the country In 2011 alonestates passed nearly three times as many abortion restrictionsas they had in any previous yearNone of this is a reaction to any changes in peoples sexual behavior or reproductive choices Its not like there was a spike in abortions causing this panic In fact theabortion rate has been declining And despite continuing media panic over adolescent sexuality the fact is thatteenagers are waiting longer to have sex on average than in the past Despite this not only are you seeing a dramatic increase in attacks on legal abortion the Christian right has expanded its attacks to contraception access suggesting that something has worked them into a panic they believe can only be resolved by trying to reassert their religious and sexual valuesThat something isnt changes in sexual behavior but its reasonable to believe its because of changes in sexual values People might not be having more sex but they are feeling less guilty about the sex they are havingSince Gallup first started polling peoplein 2001 on moral views acceptance of consensual sex between adults has skyrocketed In a decades time acceptance of premarital sex swelled from 53 to 66 of Americans and acceptance of gay Americans grew from a mere 38 to a majority of Americans Even polyamory has become more acceptable for Americans rising from being accepted by 5 of Americans to 14 The fact that these changes in attitude are rising alongside the growth of irreligiosity is not a coincidence More perhaps even than the 1960s Americans are in a period of questioning rigid sexual and religious mores and concluding in increasing numbers that they are not down with guilttripping people for victimless behavior and demanding conformity for its own sake Some of themnow a whopping 22 of Americansare leaving religion entirely Some are continuing in their faith but choosing to interpret their values differently than Christian conservatives would like And so we see Christian conservatives cracking down in a desperate bid to regain controlThey claim that theyre being oppressed by increasing tolerancefor religious diversity They have latched onto with some success the claim that religious freedomrequires giving Christiansthe right to oppress others The Republican Party is in complete thrall to the religious right to the point where giving the Christian rightone gonowhere symbolic bill instead of another one created a major political crisis The irony is that this panicbased overreach is just making the situation worse for the Christian right One ofthe biggest reasons the secularization trendhas accelerated in recent years is that young people see the victim complex and the sex policing of the Christian right and its turning them off And theyre not just rejecting conservative Christianity but the entire idea of organized religion altogether In other words the past few years have created a selfperpetuating cycle Christian conservatives in a panic over changing demographics start cracking down In reaction more people give up on religion That causes the Christian right to panic more and crack down more In the end Christian conservatives are going to hasten their own demise by trying to save themselves Not that any of us should be crying for them
