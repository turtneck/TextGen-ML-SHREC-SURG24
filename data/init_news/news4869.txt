Theyve discovered belatedly that income inequality is a problem and theyre no longer proposing to give tax breaks to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans Now they are proposing to give tax breaks to the wealthiest twotenths of 1 percent of AmericansOn Tuesday afternoon the House Rules Committee took up HR 1105 the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015 with plans to bring it to a vote on the chamber floor Wednesday  Tax Day It is an extraordinarily candid expression of the majoritys priorities A tax cut costing the treasury 269 billion over a decade that would exclusively benefit individuals with wealth of more than 54 million and couples with wealth of more than 109millionThats a tax break for only the 5500 wealthiest households in the country each year according to the Joint Committee on Taxation Of those the 318 wealthiest estates each year  those worth 50 million or more  would see an average windfall of 20million each according to the Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesAnd this at a time when the gap between rich and poor is already worse than it has been since the Great Depression Never in the history of plutocracy has so much been given away to so few who need it so littleThis is the ultimate perversion of the tea party movement which began as a populist revolt in 2009 but has since been hijacked by wealthy and corporate interests The estate tax has been part of American law in some form since 1797 according to the advocacy group Americans for Tax Fairness a shield against the sort of permanent aristocracy our founders fought to rid themselves ofIt had long been a conservative ideal and the essence of the American Dream to believe that everybody should have an equal shot at success But in their current bid to end the estate tax Republicans could create a permanent elite of trustfund babiesThe estate tax was a meaningful check on a permanent aristocracy as recently as 2001 when there were taxes on the portion of estates above 675000 even then there were plenty of ways for the rich to shelter money for their heirs As the son of a schoolteacher and a cabinetmaker Id like to see the estate tax exemptions lowered  so that taxes encourage enterprise and entrepreneurship while keeping to a minimum the number of Americans born who will never have to work a day in their lives The current exemption of 54 million the current estate tax has an effective rate averaging under 17 percent according to the UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center does little to prevent a permanent aristocracy from growing  and abolishing it entirely turns democracy into kleptocracyThe kleptocrats offer all sorts of bogus justifications for giving away 269 billion to a few thousand of the wealthiest AmericansHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan RWis appearing late Tuesday before the Rules Committee claimed that the estate tax is absolutely devastating to family farms and he claimed the repeal would remove an additional layer of taxation from assets that had already been taxedDouble taxation Americans for Tax Fairness citing Federal Reserve data notes that 55percent of the value of estates worth more than 100 million comprises unrealized capital gains that have never been taxedHurting family farmers and small businesses In the entire country only 120 small businesses and farms 100 of them large farms were hit by the estate tax in 2013 And for that tiny number affected there are all sorts of provisions already in place to soften the blow low valuation rules delayed tax payments and other breaks and discountsGOP leaders such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Ky and House Speaker John Boehner Ohio have begun to recognize that the vast gap between rich and poor is detrimental  and to blame the problem on President Obama Their solution so far has been to propose cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars from food stamps Pell grants Medicaid and other programs for those without means  and on Tax Day to give 269billion to the few who already have the mostIt sounds to me like theres a lot of wealth envy in this country Rep Virginia Foxx RNC complained while serving as chairwoman of the Rules Committee debate Tuesday The bill abolishing the estate tax she said will draw a line in the sandYes it will between the wealthiest twotenths of 1 percent  and everybody elseRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
