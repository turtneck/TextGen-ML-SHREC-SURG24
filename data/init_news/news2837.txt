Taming the corporate media beast Biden Doesnt Stand a Chance Clintons Secretary of State Will Be Vicky Nuland Originally appeared at The American Conservative Joe Biden is reportedly being considered for Secretary of State in a Clinton administration Joe Biden is at the top of the internal short list Hillary Clintons transition team is preparing for her pick to be secretary of state a source familiar with the planning tells POLITICO If Biden is on such a list I doubt he is at the top of it and my guess is that he wouldnt be the nominee in any case There are other likely choices including Victoria Nuland that would be a better fit with Clinton and would be even more likely to share her foreign policy priorities Kelley Vlahos reported earlier this year on Nulands record Where will Victoria Nuland be after January Nuland is one of Hillary Clintons protgs at the State Department and she is also greatly admired by hardline Republicans This suggests she would be easily approved by Congress as secretary of state or maybe even nationalsecurity adviserwhich in turn suggests that her foreignpolicy views deserve a closer look If Nuland can be considered a Clinton protege Biden is more of a rival During the first Obama term Biden and Clinton were frequently on opposing sides of internal foreign policy debates and in his 2015 announcement that he wouldnt run for president Biden offered what I took to be a rebuke of Clintons more aggressive foreign policy positioning We have to accept the fact that we cant solve all of the worlds problems We cant solve many of them alone The argument that we just have to do something when bad people do bad things isnt good enough Its not a good enough reason for American intervention and to put our sons and daughters lives on the line put them at risk Probably their most significant disagreement was over intervention in Libya Clinton was a major supporter and Biden saw no compelling reason for the US to intervene Biden has a fairly hawkish record over the last twenty years but even he couldnt see why the US should get involved there As recently as June he was publicly claiming vindication for opposing an intervention that Clinton touts as smart power at its best I dont see why she would want Biden as her Secretary of State and I definitely dont see why he would want to serve in her administration
