The Trump campaign is so desperate that they are openly celebrating the reopening of the FBIs investigation into Hillary Clintons emails Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway tweeted A great day in our campaign just got even better FBI reviewing new emails in Clinton probe CNNPolitics httpstcoWBltG2lAK6  Kellyanne Conway KellyannePolls October 28 2016 The problem with the idea that the emails will save Donald Trump and the Republican Party is that Clinton was beating Trump while the FBI did their first investigation into her emails Clinton has led Trump all through the Congressional hearings into her emails She led Trump throughout the FBI investigation into her emails Clinton won the Democratic nomination with her emails being a story The point is that Hillary Clintons emails arent a big issue to the majority of voters The people who arent Republicans in this election dont care about her emails When compared to Trump sexually assaulting women not paying federal income taxes and being sued in two states for fraud the emails seem like a quaint political scandal from a much simpler time There has also never been a shred of proof that Hillary Clinton did anything wrong Republicans cant get past the basic hurdle of needing actual evidence to back up their email conspiracy Hillary Clinton is facing Donald Trump in this election and only a moron or a truly desperate campaign manager clinging on the last bit of hope that she can find would believe that the reopening of an email investigation will make a bit of difference on election day The voters are speaking and they dont care about Hillary Clintons emails
