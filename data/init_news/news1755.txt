Donald Trump has had a very toughthree weeks on the campaign trail from a badfirst debate to the Access Hollywood video to the recent flood of allegations thathe groped and made unwanted sexual advances toward severalwomenAnd yetTrump trails Hillary Clinton by just fourpoints in the new Washington PostABC News poll  a number that is pretty par for the course for the 2016 electionButthe PostABC poll also makes this clear about what Trump is up to these days Hes doing almost everything wrong and hes doing nothing to grow his support and actually put himself in a position to winTrump has spent the better part of the past week arguing that his comments on tape were just locker room talk attempting to cast doubt onthe accusations made against him by an increasing number of women and pressing the case that the Clintons misdeeds are worse than the ones hes alleged to have committedThe problem is that a majority of voters are buying none of itSo why hasnt he lost much ground  at least in this poll other polls last week showed him losing much more and down double digits Part of it is rank partisanship About4 in 10 likely voters appear willing to give him a pass on most of the things described aboveThose who appear unconcerned are largely GOPleaning voters already supporting Trump And thats probablywhy he remains at 43 percent in a fourway matchup with Hillary Clinton Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Partys Jill SteinBut that brings us back to the problem that has plagued Trump since the GOP primary his inability to grow his support among the general electorate Trump is doing basically nothing in response to his problems these past few weeks that is being met withbroad supportHe has long run and continues to run a campaign that is very much focused on the Republican Party base and that base doesnt seem to have deserted him at this point But that base alone is also insufficient to win an election in the United StatesTrump remains in this race almost completely despite himself and with an assist from Clintons own popularity problems Those are problems we would note that are largely due to things she did beforethis campaign  in contrast to Trump Hell probably see the headtohead number from this poll showing him down only fourpoints and think hes doing just fine and could still winIf so hewill be missing the point entirely
