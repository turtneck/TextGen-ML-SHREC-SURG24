Ted Cruz took first prize in the Iowa caucuses but in the days before the New Hampshire primary not many people are treating the Texas senator like a winnerInstead the talk has turned to a clash between Marco Rubio and Donald Trump the two frontrunners in the Granite State and how one has to lose a bit less than the other in order to claim victory And whenever Cruzs name comes up it tends to be connected to accusations over the dirty tricks he allegedly played to win Iowa Now with victory in New Hampshire looking increasingly unlikely Cruz risks looking like a third wheel Saturdays Republican debate is a crucial opportunity for him to prevent that fate but to do so he just somehow swipe support from either Trump or RubioCruz goes into the debate with the curse of the Iowa winner looming over him Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum fellow Christian conservatives who won the caucuses in the past two elections both ended up losing the nomination In those elections the winner in New Hampshire ended up with the Republican nomination While Trump is currently the frontrunner he also happens to be entirely unpredictable and apparently disinterested in running a coherent ground game Cruz on the other hand has a strong campaign organization in New Hampshire but is unlikely to win the state thanks to a Rubio surgethat is unless the polls are misleading as they were in IowaWinning Iowa at all costs has also put a target on Cruzs back In the wake of his victory come accusations from Trump and Ben Carson that the Cruz campaign cheated its way to first place with Trump calling for the Iowa results to be invalidated and Cruz indicted for voter fraud When Trump with an assist from Carson inevitably turns his wrath on Cruz on Saturday he will attack the Texans integrity and cast him as a political sneak a description that does tend to befit Cruzs reputation The rest of the candidates will likely tear at him too given his winners status in Iowa Luckily for Cruz few people watch debates on a Saturday nightBut most important Cruz now faces two opponents whom he narrowly beat in Iowa and who are setting themselves up for the showdown he wanted to participate in The inevitability of his loss in New Hampshirepolls already show him dropping after Rubios Iowa performancehas set up the renegade Trump in one corner and the establishment Rubio in the other Though Cruz has long trumpeted his own ideological purity Trump has staked out voters to the far right while Rubio increasingly fortifies his own position in the center thanks to a bevy of endorsements leaving Cruz as the man uncertainly nebulously floating somewhere in betweenFor Cruz his goal on Saturday is not just survival but to remind the nation that he continues to be relevant as Rubio and Trump suit up for the colossal intraparty philosophical clash that has loomed over the Republican primary But barring a moment on the stage where Trump or Rubio utterly completely collapse Cruz the man who won over Iowans with his religious zeal may find himself like Huckabee and Santorum before him a bit player strutting and fretting upon the debate stage and nothing more
