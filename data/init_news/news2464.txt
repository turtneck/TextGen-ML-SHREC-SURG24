Charlie Hebdo will not go away And in the wake of unspeakably hideous tragedy thats very good newsThe attack Wednesday that killed 12 members of the staff including editorial director Stephane Charbonnier was bad enough Allowing the thugs who carried out the massacre to kill the French satirical weekly would have been catastrophicDespite the deaths of most of its senior journalists the show will go on Richard Malka the papers lawyer told Le Monde And the newspaper plans to print 1 million copies a figure that dwarfs its usual print run of 60000In an interview on French television reported by the Guardian Patrick Pelloux a doctor who also writes for the paper put his finger on why this decision is essentialIts very hard he said We are all suffering with grief with fear but we will do it anyway because stupidity will not winIf Charlie Hebdo were simply to go away he said the death of his colleagues would have been for nothingCharlie Hebdo stirred up controversy with its irreverent sometimes crass take on the world It particularly offended Muslims with its treatment of the prophet MohammedExtremist zealots not known for their senses of humor hope to control the conversation through fear Whether its shooting up Paris newspaper offices beheading journalists in the Middle East or ruthlessly and relentlessly persecuting reporters and editors in despotruled nations the goal is the same Kill the messengers and make the message go awayBut it cantThe pen is mightier than the sword the saying goes But it certainly doesnt always seem that way The power of evil people who kill without conscience can make the pen or the keyboard seem frail indeed completely overmatchedYears back giving a commencement address at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland humorist Gene Weingarten brandished a mammoth scabbard and a tiny pen Gene was on to somethingBut the way truth continues to emerge is that there is often someone to pick up the shield of the slain colleague Despite the sharply escalating anger of covering international flashpoints for example journalists continue to bear the enormous risksIn Casablanca Victor Laszlo played by Paul Henreid talks about why he believes the Nazis will never prevail And what if you track down these men and kill them what if you killed all of us From every corner of Europe hundreds thousands would rise up to take our places Even Nazis cant kill that fastI cant say Im quite as sanguine as Victor was But Im very glad to see that Charlie Hebdo will go on
