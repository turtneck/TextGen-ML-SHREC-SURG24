a very positive step toward party unity He then sat down with House GOP leaders followed by a meeting with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy and other top Senate RepublicansWhile we were honest about our few differences we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground Trump and Ryan said in a joint statement We will be having additional discussions but remain confident theres a great opportunity to unify our party and win this fall and we are totally committed to working together to achieve that goal  This was our first meeting but it was a very positive
