President Obama on Tuesday followed through on his vow to veto bipartisanbacked legislation authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline marking his first veto of the Republicanled Congress and only the third of his presidencyThe president in a brief statement claimed the bill would circumvent the existing process for reviewing the pipeline which would extend from Canada to TexasThe Presidential power to veto legislation is one I take seriously Obama said But I also take seriously my responsibility to the American people And because this act of Congress conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest  including our security safety and environment  it has earned my vetoThe decision while expected was met with tough criticism from Republicans  and tees up another showdown with Congress in the coming days as GOP leaders try to overrideIts extremely disappointing that President Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill that would support thousands of good jobs and pump billions of dollars into the economy Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy said in a statement Even though the President has yielded to powerful special interests this veto doesnt end the debateMcConnells office said the Senate plans to vote on overriding sometime before March 3But so far congressional leaders have not demonstrated they have the votes to override which takes a twothirds majority in both chambersThe Keystone bill garnered 62 yeas in the Senate but they would need 67 to override In the House the bill got 270 votes  but they would need 281 to overrideIt remains unclear whether moderate lawmakers could be swayed to switch in the coming weeksWhile Tuesdays veto marked only the third of Obamas presidency  fewer than any US president since the 19th century  his sparing use of the presidential tool is likely to change With Republicans now in control of Congress their efforts to chip away at the presidents health care law and other legislative accomplishments are just as likely to be met with Obamas veto penTo date Obama rarely has used the veto in part because Democrats for six years controlled at least one chamber in Congress  acting as a buffer to prevent unwanted bills from ever reaching the presidents desk That buffer is now goneA look back at past presidencies especially where control of the White House and Congress was split during at least one point shows far more liberal use of that presidential powerIn the Clinton presidency the president issued 37 vetoes in his two terms President Ronald Reagan issued 78 President George W Bush issued 12 His father issued 44Not since the Warren G Harding administration has the number of vetoes been in the single digits Harding issued sixThe Keystone bill is as contentious an issue as any for Obama to fire his first veto shot of the new CongressFirst proposed in 2008 the Keystone pipeline would connect Canadas tar sands to Gulf Coast refineriesThe White House has said repeatedly it would wait to make its decision about whether to let the project go forward until after a State Department review It regards the legislation as circumventing that processThe Associated Press contributed to this report
