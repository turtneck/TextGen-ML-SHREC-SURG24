Donald Trump won GOP primaries in seven states and Sen Ted Cruz took three in a Super Tuesday rebound sparking renewed calls from some Republicans to unify around a single Trump rival as the billionaire tightened his hold on frontrunner statusThe contests in 11 states showcased Trumps dominance over a crowded GOP field Sen Marco Rubio Fla was the winner in one state Minnesota his first victory of the 2016 primary seasonLive updates and results from across the USTrump won Alabama Arkansas Georgia Massachusetts Tennessee Vermont and Virginia according to Edison Media Research In several states his lead was in double digits and his share of the GOP vote neared 50 percent With those wins Trump has more than doubled his victory total in this GOP primary seasonBut even as Trump basked in his Super Tuesday romp a wellfunded super PAC was ramping up its effort to discredit the New York businessman with a new television advertisement that portrays him as a predatory huckster who scammed working and middleclass AmericansThe 60second ad which will begin airing Wednesday on stations across the country at a cost of more than 1 million centers on Trump University the billionaire moguls forprofit enterprise that promised to teach students the tricks of the real estate trade and is now defunct and the subject of a fraud suitThe attack echoes themes that Rubio who is trying to unite the GOPs antiTrump forces under his own banner has advanced as he has addressed swelling crowds in suburban areasCruz won Alaska Oklahoma and his home state of Texas just after 9 pm These are the second third and fourth states Cruz has won in this race he also won the Iowa caucuses the first contest of all The win in Texas in particular was vital It saved Cruz from a humiliating homestate defeat and gave him part of the largest slate of delegates that was up for grabs TuesdayLive updates and results from across the USBut this was not the Super Tuesday that Cruz had hoped for months ago He had campaigned hard in Southern states hoping to dominate among evangelicals and very conservative voters Instead in state after state he saw those voters flock to TrumpFor Rubio the Minnesota win was a boost he sorely needed Earlier in the night Trump had mocked him for not winning any states so far But overall Tuesday was a disappointment for Rubio He had attacked Trump sharply in the past few days and shifted some latedeciding voters into his camp But outside of Minnesota it wasnt enoughOhio Gov John Kasich came in a close second to Trump in VermontThe worry among the party establishment  which has put its last hopes on Rubio  was strong and growing after Trumps Tuesday victoriesEven Sen Lindsey O Graham RSC an outspoken critic of Cruz said to CBSs Charlie Rose on Tuesday night Well I think were about ready to lose to the most dishonest politician in America Hillary Clinton and how could you do thatI made a joke about Ted but we may be in a position to have to rally around Ted Cruz as the only way to stop Donald Trump and Im not so sure that would work he said adding that when it came to that prospectI cant believe I would say yes but yesCruz addressed his supporters at a venue called the Redneck Country Club in Stafford Tex He sought not so subtly to convince Rubio to drop out of the race saying that a divided field was allowing Trump to succeedSo long as the field remains divided Donald Trumps path to the nomination remains more likely And that would be a disaster  for conservatives and for the nation And after tonight we have seen that our campaign is the only campaign that has beaten that can beat and that will beat Donald Trump Cruz said He spoke to primary voters in future states We must come togetherRubio the establishment candidate who had sharply attacked Trump in the past few days ran close to Trump in Virginia boosted by support among collegeeducated voters and Republicans in the Washington DC suburbs But he fell short with Trump piling up large margins in the states rural South and WestNo Republican nominee has ever won all the states Trump hasStill exit polls showed some good news for Rubio In several states he did well among voters who decided late according to media reports That could be taken as proof that Rubios late attacks on Trump worked  and it could encourage Rubio to continue them hoping to win more primaries in the coming weeksJust five days ago we began to unmask the true nature of the frontrunner so far in this race Five days ago we began to explain to the American people that Donald Trump is a con artist And in just five days we have seen the impact it is having all across the country Rubio told supporters in Miami We are seeing in state after state his numbers coming down Our numbers going upHe looked ahead to the Republican primary in Florida on March 15 a winnertakeall contest that could vault Rubio back into contention  or if he loses doom himRubios campaign has sought to position him as the top alternative to Trump the one whod be waiting and ready when voters  or delegates at a fractious GOP convention  finally turned on the frontrunner But Tuesdays results showed that isnt exactly true In six of the nine states where polls have closed in fact Rubio was running thirdTrump spoke to supporters at his MaraLago resort in Palm Beach Fla in an ornate ballroom In his speech he mocked Rubio calling him the little senator and reminding his crowd that Rubio didnt win anything He hasnt won anything periodOvershadowed by Trump and Rubio Cruz sees Texas as his last stand Trump also called his campaign a movement and sought to look ahead to a general election contest against Clinton the former secretary of stateI am a unifier When we get all of this finished Im going to go after one person Hillary Clinton Trump said He rejected suggestions that his comments  about Mexican immigrants mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and a ban on Muslim foreigners entering the country  had divided his partyWe are going to be a much finer party Were going to be a unified party Trump said I mean to be honest with you And we are going to be a much bigger party Our party is expandingLater Trump responded to a question by saying hed been watching all the big cableTV news networks and liked them all See Im becoming diplomatic he saidIn a wideranging news conference that followed Trumps speech he issued a kind of threat to House Speaker Paul Ryan RWis who  before Trump came on the scene  had a claim to being the most popular figure in the GOPPaul Ryan I dont know him well Trump said Im sure Ill get along with him And if I dont Hell have to pay a big priceIt seemed possible given Tuesdays results that Rubio Cruz and Kasich could find a reason to remain in the race So even where Trump lost Tuesday night he may have won  reaping the benefits of a crowded field of candidates and splitting the antiTrump vote into piecesFormer pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson who has failed to win a single primary or caucus so far told supporters he was dismayed with the state of the nations political system and not prepared to quit the race yetIt is rotten it is rotten to the core Carson told a crowd of supporters in Baltimore Im not ready to quit untangling it quite yetCarson has called on the five remaining candidates to meet privately in Detroit in advance of Thursdays upcoming GOP Fox News Channel debate He has asked them to take a pledge to talk about the many serious problems facing our country instead of personally attacking each

place in Houston where Cruz cast his vote Tuesday Francisco Valle 74 held a sign depicting Trump with a Hitlerstyle mustache and his right hand raised it read absolutely no Mexicans Valle also hung a sign with the letter T and word Trump in the shape of a swastika with STOP written beneathI am here because I want to make awareness of a movement that is very dangerous to all the minorities because Hitler started the same way said Valle who is Mexican American He blamed the Jews for all the problems and now Trump is blaming the Mexicans for the problemsTrump has suggested he is expanding the GOPs base of support by appealing to Democrats and independents even though some say he is alienating some traditional Republican backersWe have tremendous numbers of people coming in and the Republican Party is growing larger he said If it fails to do that he added its not going to winWagner reported from Burlington Vt Eilperin from Washington Katie Zezima in Houston Patricia Sullivan in
