At last nights final presidential debate the GOP presidential nominee refused to say that he would honor and accept the results of the election Instead he said he would keep you in suspenseThis is indeed horrifying as his opponent Hillary Clinton said But it should come as no surprise It has been clear from the beginning that Trump does not accept smalld democratic normsIn the first Republican primary debate last August Trump running as a Republican refused to say that he would support the eventual nominee Thats fair enough on its own especially considering that several of the other GOP candidates eventually refused to do so But it was also a warning Trump would honor the norms of the electoral process he would not as a matter of course accept its legitimacyThe rejection of both the norms and legitimacy of democracy has been a consistent theme throughout Trumps public career In 2012 after Barack Obama won the election Trump went on a long twitter rant arguing that the election was a total sham and a travesty and that we are not a democracyThroughout the campaign Trump has treated the norms of democracypeace acceptance respect for the electoral process and for the limits of presidential powerwith disdain if not outright hostilityAt his rallies he has explicitly encouraged supporters to engage in violent acts against protesters Since winning the nomination he has repeatedly declared that the election is rigged raising the specter of voter fraud that has been consistently repeatedly proven to be almost entirely imaginary Before that he warned darkly that if his nomination did not go through at the Republican convention there might be riotsOver and over again throughout his campaign Trump has disrespected the Constitution and promised to violate its most essential rules He has dismissed the idea of free speech promised to seize the assets of foreign nationals and suggested that Muslims should be forced to register in a federal database He has repeatedly promised to order the military to commit war crimes He has derided core constitutional principles arguing dismissively that the Constitution is not a suicide pact Trump who clearly does not understand the Constitution does not believe in the sanctity of its provisions or even in its general guidance He believes only in his own illinformed whimsTrumps lack of respect for the Constitution is matched only by his praise for the strength of authoritarian dictators He has been fulsome in his praise for Russian leader Vladimir Putins strength and has similarly expressed his admiration for other authoritarian leaders such as Saddam Hussan Muammar Gaddagi and Bashar alAssad At last nights debate he repeatedly dismissed the notion confirmed by multiple US intelligence agencies that Russia was behind the hack of democratic emails and seemed to side with Putin for having outsmarted the United States All the available evidence indicates that Trump is not a fan of the imperfect democracy that is the United States but quite admires foreign authoritarians specifically for their authoritarian tendenciesOver and over again Trump has expressed his desire to implement authoritarian unconstitutional policies in the USbanning Muslims from entering the country closing down Mosques retaliating against media outlets that publish critical reports about Trump and their owners One of Trumps favorite lines is that only I can solve the problems he says ail the countryPart of the problem is that Trump perceives himself as an eternal winner Therefore any loss can only be someone elses fault That is how we ended up with a presidential debate in which Trump interrupted his opponent to declare again that he should have gotten an Emmy for his reality TV show The Apprentice Trump had insisted that the Emmy awards were also rigged against him The mans vast personal vanity is inseperable from his authoritarian outlookAt this point it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Trump is not really running for president of a democratic republic he is running to be its unchecked and unaccountable leader free from the shackles of constitutionally limited democracy he so clearly despises
