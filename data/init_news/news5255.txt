On Wednesday Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump delivered a planned speech on his Democratic opponent Hillary Clintonand according toSlatecolumnist and Clinton supporter Michelle Goldbergitwasprobably the most unnervingly effective one he has ever given in which he skillfully combined truth and falsehood into a plausibleseeming picture meant to reinforce listeners underlying beliefsThough packed with fabrications as usual the Republican presidential nominee avoided blatant and obvious lies bizarre conspiracy theories although he did claim that foreign governments may have a blackmail file on Clinton while discussing the email scandal which is entering Alex Jones territory and personal insults  all of which he had previously employed in his attacks on ClintonAgain the speech wasextremely dishonest in many parts but the falsehoodswere more subtle and less downright loony and thus much more effectiveOver the past couple of weeks Trumphas done a lot to sabotage his own campaign from his racist attacks on the Hispanic judge overseeing the classaction lawsuit against Trump Universityto his shameless Tweet congratulating himself after the Orlando mass shooting This has led some toconcludethat the billionairedoesnt really want to be presidentand really who can blame him and is deliberately running his campaign into a wall Since becoming the nominee almost two months ago his already atrocious favorability ratings have continued to drop and according to aBloomberg surveyfrom last week66 percent of Americans now view him unfavorablyThere is no doubt that the election is Clintons to lose The former Secretary of States campaign is a welloiled machine that currently has aboutfortytimes as much cash on hand as the Trump campaignAnd while Clinton is overwhelmingly distrusted and disliked by the public the idea of a Donald Trump presidency tends to scare more than half of Americans and he has done a great job at repelling women and people of color over the past yearHowever if Trump can refrain from attacking Bill Clintons infidelities and accusing the couple of plotting the murder of a friend and colleague Vince Foster and instead makesubstantive criticisms and there are plenty of substantive criticisms to be made he could potentiallymake Clintons life much more difficultin the months aheadOf course it is unlikely that Trump will actually do this he has proven time and again that he has a natural aversion towards substantive debate and prefers touting conspiracy theories and making personal attacks He is an impulsive bully whose propensity for pettiness knows no bounds But the sheer political baggage of Clinton does make her very vulnerable indeedFrom her ties to big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs whether incampaign contributionsorpaid speeches to the Clinton Foundations financial connectionstoforeign governmentslike Saudi Arabiaalong with ugly and inconvenient truthslike the fact that Clintons state departmentapproved massive arms dealswith the aforementioned country after it had donated millions to her and Bills nonprofitor the fact that Bill earned thehighest paid speechesof his postpresidency careerwhile his wife was Secretary of State most of which weresponsoredby foreign governments and foreign organizationsIf Trump sticks to these kinds of facts in his criticisms of Clinton without straying into Alex Jones or Donald Trump the mindless bully territory Hillarys path to the White House could become increasingly complicated It does make you wonder after being dogged by scandals and conspiracy theories ever since they entered the national spotlight did Hillary and Bill think that giving highpriced speeches forpubliclydespised companies like Goldman Sachs and General Electric accepting millions of dollars from foreign governments and organizations for their foundation or cozying up with shady donors like Sant Chatwal and Frank Giustra all of these companies individuals and governments are interested in buying influence and to say otherwise is delusional would be ignored by their opponents As I havepreviously noted it takes a special kind of arrogance to think this way although its possible that Hillary expected her Republican opponent to be even more tainted by big donors being a Republican and allOf course Donald Trump is an entirely different kind of corrupt He hasnt been inpolitics his entire life and doesnt have a history of accepting big donations from Wall Street and corporate AmericaInstead the billionaire is simply a charlatan and a fraudwhether its swindling vulnerable working people into buying sham Trump University degrees or fearmongering bullying and flagrantlylying his way to the nomination Trump is the lovechild of PT Barnum and George Wallace a shameless selfpromoter with an ego that makes Kanye West look humble and a temperamentthat makes Joe McCarthy seem refinedAnd these qualities will probably get the better of him in the months ahead The buffoonish billionaire will most likelycontinue rambling incoherentlyabout conspiracy theories that hes read on Infowarscom and mocking Bubbas infidelities and for this Clinton should be grateful
