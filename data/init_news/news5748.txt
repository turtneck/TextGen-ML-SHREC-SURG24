Pope Francis on Tuesday announced sweeping revisions to the Catholic Churchs marriage annulment process changes that are designed to speed up and simplify the often lengthy procedure The revisions according to Vatican experts appear to bethe mostfarreaching made to the churchs annulment process in centuriesThe announcement featuring changes that willmake it easier for Catholics to remarry comes about a month before a major meeting at the Vatican where Catholic leadership will examine the churchs views on family issues including divorce and remarriageThechanges will eliminate a requirement that all annulment decisions get a second judgment and will allow local bishops to expedite the annulment process for some cases The annulment process will be free of charge though many dioceses had already eliminated the administrative fees for marriage annulments according to a Vatican spokesmanThe revisions also expandthe role of localbishops in judging nullificationproceedingsAlthough dramatic thechanges do not alter the Catholic Churchs teaching that marriages are permanentThe revisions were announced in two Apostolic Letters from Francis which translated from their Latin titles are called The Gentle Judge The Lord Jesus andThe Meek and Merciful JesusThe documents were released in Latin and Italian at a Vatican news conferenceCurrent Catholic teaching on marriage doesnt recognize divorce Catholics who are granted a civil divorce and then remarry are ineligible to take Communion a key part of active Catholic life Instead a Catholic who wants to end his or her marriage must be granted an annulment a process that many Catholics believe is too costly and complicatedWhat has Pope Francis actually accomplished Heres a look at 8 of his most notable statementsThe popes changes dont resolve whether divorced and remarried Catholics may take communion the Rev Thomas Rosica an Englishlanguage spokesman for the Vatican said in an email instead they put the questioninto a new context for further examination by the churchThe changes will probably split Catholic opinion between those who believe that a streamlining of the annulment process is needed and will help bring back more Catholics to the church and those who worry that the revisions could make it too easy to move on from a marriage which Catholic teaching dictates is apermanentsacramentIn a recent Pew poll 62 percent of American Catholics said the church should allow Catholics who divorce and remarry without an annulment to receive CommunionThe number of annulments in the United States has been on the decline in recent decades Annulment procedures in the country dropped from 72308 in 1989 to 23302 in 2014 according to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate at Georgetown UniversityVast majority of US Catholics who left the church cant imagine returning study saysAn annulment is granted by a Catholic tribunal if it agrees that a marriage originally thought to be valid wasactually missing at least one crucial element from the start meaning that it was never really a true marriage in the first place The length of the process varies between dioceses but can take 12 to 18 months according to the US Conference of Catholic BishopsOne of the changes implemented by the pope will eliminate the second instance of that tribunalmeaning that all couples seeking annulment will have to obtain only one sentence from a single tribunal The moral certainty reached by the first judge according to law should be sufficient the letter readsIts a sweeping reform its a dramatic reform saidChad Pecknold a theologian at Catholic University Its a reform which essentially takes away the whole judicial process for deciding whether a marriage was null or notAnother change will reduce the process of that first tribunal down to one judge Pecknold noted Formerly a tribunal consisted of at least two priests and one canon lawyer who could be a layman or clericFrancis has changed that and placed the responsibility of the first instance of the tribunal into the hands of a single judge who must always be a member of the clergyPecknold added A lot of my canon lawyer friends want to quit todayAusten Ivereigh a papal biographer and commentator on the Vatican called it revolutionary that Francis has granted bishops the power to nullify a marriage  a power that has rested with church courts Bishops he said could also delegate that power to priests This will make annulments more accessible especially in much of the developing world where Ivereigh said many areas have no church courtsThis is the most farreaching reform to the Churchs nullity process in 300 years he addedTuesdays announcement is procedural and makes no change in the way the church sees marriage and its permanent natureHowever Ivereigh said the change shows Francis has been listening to regular Catholics and the reason for this change is that society has changed This speededup procedure recognizes and reflects a new realityHe predicted that some conservatives would be critical of this change because they will see it undermining the concept of marriage as a bond that cannot be dissolved The bestknown of this group is American Cardinal Raymond Burke who led the Vaticans supreme court until he was removed by Francis because Ivereigh said Burke opposed annulment changesAnother change announced Tuesday will allow bishops the ability to further expedite the annulment process for some particularly straightforward cases  a process that Pecknold said would allow the bishop to essentially write a noteThat process could be open to abuse he added The moment that you put in an exception that makes everybodys job easier guess what everybodys going to doKurt Martens a professor of canon law at Catholic University said the expedited process would apply to Catholic couples facingcertain conditions including those who have an abortion a grave contagious disease children from a previous relationship or imprisonment Essentially Martens said the church is providing a path that looks like the Catholic version of nofault divorceVIDEO Pope emphasizes forgiveness for abortions during year of mercyThe changes move the church away from a set of 18thcentury safeguardsmeant to make sure that the annulment process wasnt subject to abuse Martens said Those changes set up by Pope Benedict XIV included a provision that would require a mandatory appeal of the lower courts decisionWhat guarantee do you have for a fair trial if you take away those guarantees that were put in the past Martens said Sometimes you want to go so quickly you miss elements and make mistakes Procedure law takes time to unfoldMartens said the way Francis changed the annulment process was unusual because he did not go through the Synod on the Family as expected in OctoberIf I were a bishop I would be upset Martens said Its a bit strange and even a sign of contradiction that a pope who is big on consultation and collegiality seems to forget that on something like this Its highly unusual for legislation like this to get through that wayFrancis for his part acknowledged some of those concerns in his lettersThe extent to which an abbreviated process of judgment might put the principle of the indissolubility of marriage at risk did not escape me Francis wrote Thus I have desired that in such cases the Bishop himself shall be constituted judge who by force of his pastoral office is with Peter the greatest guarantor of Catholic unity in faith and in disciplineDespite those concerns the changes come with a notable silver lining for Catholics seeking to annul their marriages and return to a closer relationship with the churchIn terms of the average Catholic who is seeking annulment this makes an already painful situation easier and that is Pope Franciss intent Pecknold said You can see a clear pastoral eye on this decision He doesnt want any long waits he basically wants the decision to come from the bishopFrancis has spokenbefore of his desire to reform annulment in the pastThe sacraments give us gracehe saidearlier this year to jurists of the churchs final court of appeals for annulments And a marriage proceeding  like an annulment  touches on the sacrament of marriageHow I wish all marriage proceedings were free of charge he addedIn August Francis
