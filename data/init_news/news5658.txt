Goldman Sachs Endorses Hillary Clinton For President   Shadowproof Hes with her On Sunday former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton earned the endorsement of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein an endorsement she had been working toward for years As was revealed by Wikileaks Hillary Clinton spent the run up to her presidential campaign giving speeches to Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks where she praised their talents and explained her positions on financial regulation On October 24 2013 Clinton told Goldman Sachs that DoddFrank had to be done mostly for political reasons because Congress needed to look like it was doing something about the crisis She said Theres nothing magic about regulations too much is bad too little is bad How do you get to the golden key how do we figure out what works And the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry Yes she essentially endorsed Wall Street writing the rules because Wall Street knows its business best and complained to Goldman Sachs that regulations had frightened bankers I mean right now there are so many places in our country where the banks are not doing what they need to do because theyre scared of regulations theyre scared of the other shoe dropping theyre just plain scared so credit is not flowing the way it needs to to restart economic growth Clinton said So people are you know a little  theyre still uncertain and theyre uncertain both because they dont know what might come next in terms of regulations but theyre also uncertain because of changes in a global economy that were only beginning to take hold of Music to Wall Streets ears For Goldman Sachs was there really any other choice this cycle After all they did pay Hillary Clinton 675000 for those three speeches and have generously supported her political career Despite her private comments to Goldman Sachs Hillary Clinton has taken a tough public position on Wall Street during the campaign likely due to Senator Bernie Sanders success in the primaries Of course Wikileaks also revealed that Clinton told the National Multihousing Council in a private speech that you need both a public and a private position So the real question is what do Blankfein and Goldman want in return and what is Clintons private position on giving it to them Share This Article
