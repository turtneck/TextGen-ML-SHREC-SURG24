First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the days most important political stories and why they matterA week out from Election Day heres the only thing were sure of after Fridays bombshell political news that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is one again looking at Hillary Clintons emails Another US institution  the FBI  has taken a hit Its especially true after all of the obvious leaks coming from the FBI and Justice Department And that news isnt good for the countrys democracy Back in 2014 our national NBCWSJ poll looked at Americans confidence in 15 different institutions and industries and majority had confidence in just two of themSo this lack of confidence in American institutions was taking place BEFORE this presidential election and you can only imagine what the situation is going to look like afterwards As for Comey and his decision to make his announcement 11 days before an election we understand he was in a loselose situation If he withheld this information before the election it could have been equally damaging But the problem was how vague Comeys letter to Congress was as well as the fact that it was sent before the FBI even had access to the emails Its hard to reconcile Comey being so transparent with a July press conference and then testimony to Capitol Hill  over a matter where there were no charges  and then so opaque in a letter to Congress just days before the electionTeam Trump deals with its share of negative storiesWhile the Clinton campaign is still dealing with the fallout from Fridays news Halloween night saw several tough stories aimed at Team Trump There was the New York Times report on new tax documents showing Trump used a legally dubious method to avoid paying taxes NBC News reported that the FBI has been conducting a preliminary inquiry into Donald Trumps former campaign manager Paul Manaforts foreign business connections and Mother Jones reported that a veteran spy gave the FBI information alleging a Russian operation to cultivate ties to TrumpToday in Pennsylvania meanwhile Trump and running mate Mike Pence will deliver a policy speech to repeal and replace Obamacare Its a smart move for the Trump camp to focus on policy when everyone is paying attention A Trump aide previews the speech to NBCs Peter Alexander The speech will be delivered along with several of those congressional leaders who the Trump Administration will work with to immediately repeal and replace it Whats even more powerful is that well have Gov Pence there to address how he has successfully navigated Indiana through this mess and created a model for other states to followThis weeks NBCSurveyMonkey tracking poll has Clinton ahead by 6 points over Trump in the fourway horserace 4741  which is exactly where it was last week Moreover that sixpoint 4741 lead was identical in interviews before the Comey news Monday through Friday and after Saturday and Sunday More from the poll Likely voters were split on whether they thought the controversial announcement by the FBI was an important issue to discuss or more of a distraction to the campaign A slight majority of likely voters nationwide55 percentsaid it was an important issue Fortyfour percent said the news was more of a distraction to the campaign Now the national Washington PostABC tracking poll has Trump up a point though thats in contrast to the other tracking polls weve seen after the Comey newsThe Comey Surprise might not have hurt Hillary Clintons presidential chances But it might have hurt downballot Democrats who were counting on a large Clinton margin over Trump While FBI Director James Comeys email bombshell is unlikely to dent her White House chances Democrats fear it might shorten her coattails and threaten their prospects of retaking the Senate NBCs Alex SeitzWald writes Its certainly not helpful said Missouri Democratic Party Chairman Roy Temple It kind of pollutes the Democratic brand in a way thats unnecessary simply because it doesnt actually involve any new information which is why the frustration at Comey is so high right now More The slightest breeze in any direction can really push these races one way or another said Ian Prior of the Senate Leadership Fund a deeppocketed GOP Super PAC All you need is need is 01 percent in a close race By the way a Monmouth poll from yesterday showed a tied race in Indianas Senate race which isnt good news for Democrats bid to retake the SenateBurr says gun owners may want to put a bullseye on ClintonBut this story wont help

locked in a tight race for reelection quipped that as he walked into a gun shop nothing made me feel better than seeing a magazine about rifles with a picture of Hillary Clinton on the front of it Burr apologized The comment I made was inappropriate and I apologize for it But the audio CNN obtained also contained this other sound from Burr in which he said hed work to keep Clinton from filling
