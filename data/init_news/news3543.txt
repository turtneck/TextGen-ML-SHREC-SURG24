Here is a review of some of the latest significant emails and a bit of background behind the story We are now close to 38000 emails released by WikiLeaks By White House UFOGeneral William Neil McCasland former head of the WPAFB lab where it is believed the Roswell wreckage went makes comments on how to deal with UFO disclosureI was thinking a bit more about what a White House memo should say Something like these points to all Federal Agencies  In light of the Presidents policy on STEM citing official policy encouraging the study of science technology engineering and math  some back ground on your project  the Administration encourages a favorable Public Affairs position by all Agencies  appointes NASA to lead this kind of public outreach is in NASAs job jar and if no Agency is appointed all will simply note and file the memo and likely do nothing  and to coordinate with DoD DNI and NOAA the other major space actors putting a bit of light on themGeneral William N McCaslandhttpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid33739 Two Key New Podesta UFO Emails Studying them Now httpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid33552 Tom DeLonge speaking to Podesta about Rolling Stone Magazine They dont know yet where you exist in this Sekret Machines Universe we launch the story with NY Times with Doc Trailer in a week and they already look to you in a leadership role they can trust And care almost ONLY about your voice in thishttpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid33739 DeLonge again speaking to PodestaThe ranking General probably William N McCasland on my committee has some ideas for a memo that would help provide context for his and the other Officers work on this projectAlso two new WikiLeaks Podesta UFO emails about Edgar Mitchell httpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid33722 httpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid33713 In late September 2015 John Podesta posted a tweet asking actress Lena Dunham to ask Hillary Clinton about the aliens the next time she did an interview This led to a situation where the Clinton campaign was waiting for some reporter to ask about aliensNothing would happen until late December when New Hampshire reporter Daymond Steer asked but on November 5th Hillary was on the late night Jerry Kimmel show One leaked email points out that Hillary was waiting for the UFO question and had practised an answer The question didnt happen and Hillary was very disappointed In a reply to a query by Podesta asking how the Kimmel show went Kristina Schake who job in the Clinton campaign is to remake Hillarys image as she had done for Michelle Obama told PodestaShe was charming got lots of laughs and worked in a lot of message including climate change He didnt end up asking her about UFOs She was very disappointed She practiced UAPs for 5 minutes beforehand Hillary would appear again on the Kimmel show in March 2016 and did get the UFO question during that appearance Unfortunately the five minutes practise did not help as she called UAPs unexplained aerial phenomena instead of unidentified aerial phenomenaHillary on Jimmy Kimmel Showhttpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid7734New Names Dragged Down the UFO Rabbit HoleIn Late December 2015 reporter Daymond Steer in Conway New Hampshire took up John Podestas challenge to ask Hillary Clinton about the aliens It created a story that went around the worldNow we are seeing the first reaction to that news story in the Podesta emails In a WikiLeaks email on January 7 2016 Ann M OLeary a senior policy advisor in Hillary Clintons 2016 Presidential Campaign writes Podesta Judge Tatel  John  This article on Hillarys comments about extraterrestrial life made me think of you two and remind me to connect you Judge David TatelJohn  As I was telling David the last time I saw him the two of you are the biggest believers in ET life who I know and I think youd enjoy talking with one another I know that neither of you have much time but I think youd have a fascinating time discussing it if you ever get together Warmly Ann Ann M OLeary with Hillary Clintonhttpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid29385On April 30 2015 Terri Mansfield wrote John Podesta There are two significant things to nhttpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid29385ote1 Terri is requesting a meeting between Astronaut Edgar Mitchell and President Obama after the planned one on one meeting with John Podesta arrangements were being made for this meeting but it never took place2 More importantly Terri tells Podesta Edgar has consulted on consciousness matters for American presidents in the past This is significant because consciousness is the key to the UFO mystery There are some hints that the main man behind the present group working to disclose knew the holographic consciousness connectionhttpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid27026 After Podesta made his now infamous tweet that his biggest disappointment of 2014 was not getting disclosure of the UFO files he started to receive some email inquiries for interviewsIn one leaked email he tells his assistant to tell the reporter from NPR in Wisconsin that he cant do the interview and ignore the rest of the requestsOne of the emails he gets ins from Robert Fish who wrote a book on the recovery of the Apollo 11 capsule in the Pacific Ocean It was originally sent to researcher Leslie Ken When she did not reply Fish sent it to Podesta Fish indicated that everyone is looking in the wrong location for the UFO In a second email from Bob Fish who wrote the book on the recovery of the Apollo 11 capsule in the pacific he tells Podesta of things he had heard such asNo one could get into the cafeteria without TSSCI clearances so this was not a lightweight group of gossipers One of these times a member of that group was really excited  said theyd just picked up Fastwalker Fish wrote more of the reality of UFOs that he had experienced in his career in a March 6 2015 emailIn that same TSSCI building cafeteria in El Segundo I had lunch with a senior USAF NCO who had worked for Project Blue Book in the 1970s after it had been officially disbanded He was an ELINT technician electronic intelligence who flew in RC135s from MacDill AFB in Florida The normal target was Cuba where they did lots of snooping and sometimes challenging the Cubans to turn on radar and other systems He said there were times when they were diverted from these missions to track UFOs off the east coast of Florida His claim was they UFOs had a landing and takeoff spot in the ocean east of Miami north of Bermuda He also claimed there was a specific electronic signature frequency emanating from them when they were going into or coming out of the water so they were easy to track On several occasions they filmed the UFO as it transitioned from water to air or vice versa One last item is he was occasionally assigned to fly in a USAF weather aircraft WC135 when they had a hurricane hunting mission over the usual UFO area where his specific assignment was kept secret from the other crew members He would always report back to a dedicated USAF intelligence officer on base when they returned from a mission He did not know where the intel that he collected was sent for processing or storage WPAFB in Dayton would be the obvious choice High quality film of UFOs is out there somewhere httpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid31721 On Feb 5 2016 John Podesta wrote to his assistant proposing a tweet to be made in reply to the news that astronaut Edgar Mitchell had diedJohn Podesta wrote We should tweet something like Sad to learn of the passing of Edgar Mitchell an American hero Ck his Wikipedia page to make sure that wont seem too goofy Hes A big UFO guy Former astronaut Edgar Mitchellhttpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid31715 One thing that has been overlooked in the coverage of the PodestaHillary WikiLeaks UFO story is the people who are being copied by John PodestaIn the emails where John has received UFO questions he has either copied or asked for input from the following people from the presidential campaign or from the Institute for American Progress that Podesta founded One estimate stated that 40 of the highlevel officials in the Obama administration came from this institute Take a close at the names These are not people off the

October 26 there are 14 emails to and from John Podesta attempting to arrange a meeting between astronaut Edgar Mitchell with Podesta andor President Obama The topic of the proposed meeting would be Zeropoint energy and UFO disclosure The two latest released emails were sent by Terri Mansfield on January 21 2015Terri MansfieldThe first letter sent through Podesta assistant Eyrn Sepp mentioned an article just published by USA Today which pointed out that nearly 130000 pages of declassified UFO records from Project Blue Book had just been put online Edgars letter statedI grew up in Roswell my family knew Oppenheimer Lets get our meeting time and date set up ASAP so we can move forward on our unprecedented discussion concerning disclosure of our ETI from a contiguous universe and their connection to zeropoint energy for humanityhttpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid32937The second letter written later in the day was a more specific request for a meeting Although the email mentions Podesta no longer with the White House Podesta was still at the White House for almost another month when he produced his famous tweet saying he had once again not been able to release the UFO documents It may have been that he had given notice to leave and Edgar had become aware of thisNow that you are no longer serving in the White House I write to you and Eryn requesting our face to face meeting to discuss zeropoint energy and Disclosure Our Quantrek science intuitive has provided us with a few facts about our nonviolent contiguous universe ETI who promote PACIFISM among humans and with whom we work1 All true ETI do not inhabit this universe2 Socalled ETIs inhabit this universe and are in fact just celestials They are higher in rank then discarnate spirits even those who are evolved HOWEVER THEY JUST MIRROR VIOLENCE ON EARTH FEELING THREATENED BY CONTAMINATION OF THEIR ABODE3 Extrauinversal ETIs on the other hand have long ago evolved past violence relying on spiritual intelligence to avert destruction4 The Phoenix Lights and other sightings have provided ample evidence that Earth has been visited by beings whose intention is purely peace and who have nonviolently hovered over Phoenix and other sites waiting to be asked to help when they could most easily have destroyed the city with their uses of consciousness These sightings have been witnessed by thousands of people in Phoenix alone including my colleague Terri Mansfield who will accompany me on our meeting with youPlease let me now three dates and times that would work for your schedulehttpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid32833 This followed an email that had been sent by Mitchell and again sent by Terri Mansfield a week earlier In that email Mitchell requested a meeting on zeropoint energy and UFO disclosure with Podesta after he leaves in February 2015That letter was also significant in that Edgar bring up meeting a childhood friend of President Obama Edgar wroteI met with President Obamas Honolulu childhood friend US Ambassador Pamela Hamamoto on July 4 at the US Mission in Geneva when I was able to tell her briefly about zeropoint energy I believe we can enlist her as a confidante and resource in our presentation for President Obama Pamela Hamamotohttpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid1766 On March 5 2016 Eric Brys wrote an email to John Podesta titled Extraterrestrial Disclosure It was written two days after Podesta granted an interview to KLASTV in Las Vegas Nevada where he talked about the fact that unlike Bill Clinton and Obama he had convinced Hillary to disclose information being withheld about UFOs In that interview Podesta statedIve talked to Hillary about that There are still classified files that could be declassified I think Ive convinced her that we need an effort to kind of go look at that and declassify as much as we can so that people have their legitimate questions answered More attention and more discussion about unexplained aerial phenomena can happen without people  who are in public life who are serious about this  being ridiculed In his email Brys complimented Podesta on his disclosure effortI am proud of your continued efforts to disclose the truth of secret UFO files hidden from the public I will be voting for Hillary Clinton to help get you the authority you need to obtain disclosure I hope history remembers your undaunting efforts to informing the American public about extraterrestrial visitation Unlike most of the UFO emails from ordinary citizens that were not responded to Podesta took the time to answer He statedThanks for your support We will keep at it httpswikileaksorgpodestaemailsemailid33010 There is correspondence today between John Podesta and his aide Milia Fisher that took place the day before the big January 25 2016 google hangout meeting where Podesta talked UFO disclosure with the following three men Major General Neil McCasland former head of the foreign technology backengineering laboratory at WrightPatterson AFB Robert F Weiss Executive Vice President and General Manager of Aeronautics Advanced Development Programs Lockheed Martin Corporation Skunkworks and Major General Michael J Carey USAF the Special Assistant to the Commander Air Force Space Command Peterson Air Force Base ColoradoThe correspondence the day before the meeting indicated that they were expecting Tom DeLonge but his flight had been cancelled It appears then that DeLonge was scheduled to be with Podesta in and around the time of the meeting New emails may clear this upTom
