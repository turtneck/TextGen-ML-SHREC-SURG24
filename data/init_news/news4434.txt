Washington CNN Donald Trump is attempting to crack Hillary Clintons blue wall And Clinton is hoping for a surge in Latino turnout fueled by opposition to TrumpThe two candidates are making a lastminute dash across swing states like Florida Pennsylvania and North Carolina as the 2016 presidential race enters its final hours Theyve also gone north to Michigan and New Hampshire to states Democrats have won in recent cycles but could flip this yearHere are the key states and signs to study as the night unfoldsMost plausible paths to victory for Trump start with holding onto two battlegrounds that Mitt Romney won four years ago  North Carolina and Arizona  and flipping three states President Barack Obama carried Florida Ohio and IowaA loss in any of the states would severely complicate Trumps already precarious path to 270 electoral votes Though if Trump clawed back Pennsylvania or Michigan from the Democrats who have won both electoralrich states six times in a row North Carolina would be more expendable A win in a state like Pennsylvania or Michigan would allow Trump to offset a loss in North Carolina and still have a shot at reaching 270If that doesnt happen holding North Carolina and Arizona while reclaiming Florida Ohio and Iowa from the Democrats  plus Maines 2nd District  would only get him to 260Trump would need to tack on 10 more electoral votes somehow New Hampshires four and Nevadas six would get him there Colorado with nine electoral votes Michigan with 15 and Pennsylvania with 20 are also possibilitiesIn his last 48 hours before Election Day Trump has been pretty much everywhere including Colorado Michigan  even Minnesota  searching for the extra votes he needsThe key question for Clinton is whether her blue wall of Democraticleaning states on the Great Lakes  Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin  will holdTrump has targeted all three but Clinton has consistently led polls in all three states However most voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania cast their ballots on Election Day  which means her campaign hasnt built the early voting advantage already in place elsewhereIf Clinton can do that and pick up just one of North Carolina Florida or Ohio shes all but guaranteed to winIf she cant win one of those three states shell need to hold Virginia votebymail Colorado New Hampshire and Nevada  where Democrats have already built a hefty early voting edgeIf Clinton wins her coalition will consist of women collegeeducated voters and a swell of new Latino votersIn early voting in states like Nevada and Florida theres already evidence of burgeoning Latino turnout This is best witnessed by the over 57000 people who voted in Nevada Friday with pictures of long lines and extended hours at a Latino grocery store in Clark CountyMany firsttime voters polls show are turning out to oppose Trump And Democrats are bullish that Latinos have been underpolled through the entire 2016 election cycleFor Reince Priebus the Republican National Committee chairman this is a ghost of elections past After the 2012 race the RNC warned that the party needed to do more to court Latino voters A nominee who roundly rejected that advice could be the reason the party loses a third consecutive presidential raceJust as Trumps attacks on Mexican immigrants have alienated Latino voters his attacks on women and allegations of sexual assault have helped Clinton to a large lead among female voters Clintons campaign has highlighted Trumps most derogatory remarks in TV ads aimed at moderate suburban women  a constituency that has helped Republican nominees in years past If she succeeds it would limit Trumps strengths to rural areasTrumps biggest strength is his overwhelming support from disaffected white voters  particularly men and especially those without college degreesHis campaign has long argued that those voters  many of them independent or Democrats who buy into Trumps protectionist stance on trade  will carry him on Election DayFor this to happen Trump will also need core Democratic voters to stay at home as wellAlready Trump appears poised to win Iowa and has polled ahead of Clinton in Ohio Hes hoping to win enough bluecollar Democrats in Pennsylvania or Michigan to win at least one of those statesMichigan in particular emerged as a tempting target in the campaigns closing days  a state hardhit by the trade deals Trump bemoans Clintons campaign raced to play defense dispatching the former secretary of state there as well as President Barack Obama for lastminute ralliesAmong Democrats biggest concerns has been whether AfricanAmerican voters  a reliably leftleaning constituency  will turn out in numbers anywhere close to their support for Obama in 2008 and 2012If the answer is no it could hobble Clinton in key states  particularly Florida and North CarolinaObama is helping carry Clintons load with black voters In a call to Tom Joyners radio show he argued that participating in this election is just as much about him as it is about ClintonAnd I know that there are a lot of people in barbershops and beauty salons you know in the neighborhoods who are saying to themselves We love Barack we love  we especially love Michelle  and so you know it was exciting and now were not excited as much he said You know what I need everybody to understand that everything weve done is dependent on me being able to pass the baton to somebody who believes in the same things I believe inSince Trump clinched the GOP nomination in May Republican Senate and House candidates have been forced to answer for everything he has said  from his attacks on a Gold Star family and an Indianaborn judges heritage to his rejection of conservative orthodoxyAs soon as the election ends Capitol Hill Republicans  especially if they retain control of both the House and Senate  will regain powerThe party will have to decide just what to do with Trumps rejection of free trade his calls for a decreased US role overseas and his criticism of GOP congressional leaders  whether he wins or losesBut adopting some of Trumps policy planks while rejecting his political style might not help much after an election driven by the candidates personalitiesFor a nation divided by a long bitter contest this could be the most important question of all Will the loser concede  and how will he or she do itTrump and Clinton are both historically unpopular presidential nominees Half the country thinks Clinton is a crook and the other half thinks Trump is a racist and misogynistAnd Trump in particular has cast the election as rigged  calling into question whether ballots that are mailed in will be counted playing up inaccurate reports of voter irregularities and claiming that voter fraud is pervasiveThe loser will play a crucial role in legitimizing the victor  or delegitimizing the winner from the outset
