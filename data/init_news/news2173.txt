Politicians Will Feel the Heat From Rising Temperatures Posted on Nov 4 2016 By Kieran Cooke  Climate News Network New research shows that the hotter it gets the quicker the pace of political change Gabor Dvornik via Flickr LONDONVoters who feel good about lifewhether it is to do with their job their marriage or even the success of their sports teamare more likely to support their politicians On the other hand those who are disgruntled and fed up are more prone to want a change of political leadership That at least is the received wisdom of political pundits Rising temperatures New research indicates that in future climate changeand specifically rising temperaturescould also be a key factor in undermining and determining political longevity The hotter it gets the theory goes the quicker the pace of political change Nick Obradovich a researcher at Harvard University in the US has conducted what is described as the first ever investigation into the relationship between temperature electoral returns and future climate change In a study published in the journal Climatic Change  Obradovich sets out to substantiate the idea that climate change by threatening feelings of wellbeing will lead to a quicker turnover of politicians and political parties There is no doubting the thoroughness of his research altogether Obradovich analysed more than 15 billion votes cast in nearly 5000 elections in 19 countries ranging from Argentina to Zambia between 1925 and 2011 This data was then set alongside meteorological records The analysis indicates says Obradovich that warmer than normal temperatures in the year prior to an election produce lower vote shares for parties already in power driving quicker rates of political turnover  Warmer than normal temperatures in the year prior to an election produce lower vote shares for parties already in power quicker rates of political turnover The study also finds that voter disgruntlement is more pronounced in warmer countries where average annual temperatures are above 21C  In these warmer places voter support shrinks by nine percentage points from one election to the next relative to office bearers in cooler electoral districts the study finds Countries lacking historical electoral dataincluding those in subSaharan Africa already feeling the impact of climate changewere not included in the research Obradovich also uses climate models to predict future voter behaviour suggesting that the pace of political change in many countries between now and the end of the century is likely to considerably speed up Climate change may increase the frequency of democratic turnover most in warmer poorer nations says the study Fickle electorates Global warming is a complex problem that can only be tackled through international agreement and longterm planning Obradovich says that faced with ever more fickle electorates politicians in future will be tempted to focus on shortterm policies instead of adopting longerterm strategies This could not only hamper the fight against climate change but also cause economic and political upheaval Turnover in nations with weak democratic institutions can upend political stabilityif incumbents in weak democracies foresee a greater risk of losing office they sometimes employ electoral fraud and preelectoral violence to maintain power says Obradovich If these methods fail incumbents loss occasionally precipitates postelectoral violence that can in turn induce broader civil conflict Kieran Cooke a founding editor of Climate News Network is a former foreign correspondent for the BBC and Financial Times He now focuses on environmental issues Advertisement
