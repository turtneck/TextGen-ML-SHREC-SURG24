The European Unions sharpening divisions over a spiraling refugee crisis broke into the open Thursday with two leaders strongly disagreeing in public over whether the asylumseekers were threatening Europes Christian rootsThat was the language used by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban as he warned Europe against allowing in mostly Muslim families A day after a drowned Syrian toddler washed up on the Turkish coast another European leader retorted that Christian values demanded helping the less fortunateThe furious exchange  a rare breach of the EUs buttoneddown decorum  came as Hungarian authorities apparently laid a trap for thousands of asylumseekers who had packed Budapests central train station after days of worsening conditions outside the station Police had blocked them from entering the station for days but allowed them in early ThursdayBut a refugeepacked train apparently bound for the Austrian border came to a halt just west of Budapest in a small town where dozens of police officers were waiting on the platform They tried to force people off the train to take them to a migrantprocessing center threatening their chances to make it onward to Western EuropeBy days end there was a standoff with the packed train surrounded by police and the migrants refusing to budge Some of the passengers received medical treatment on the platformEuropean railways become ground zero for the migrant crisisOrban Hungarys nationalist leader who has spearheaded attempts to turn back the migrants said Thursday that he had little choice but to seal his nations border with razor wire soldiers and a high fenceWe Hungarians are full of fear people in Europe are full of fear because we see that the European leaders among them the prime ministers are not able to control the situation he said in Brussels in a raw joint appearance with European Parliament President Martin Schulz Orban and Schulz a veteran politician from Germany made no attempt to paper over their differences or their distaste for each otherThe Hungarian leader blamed Germany for the crisis saying that its opendoor policy toward Syrian asylumseekers was propelling a wave of migrants to undertake dangerous journeys toward Europes heart Germany expects 800000 asylumseekers this year and it has said that it does not plan to turn away SyriansThe moral human thing is to make clear Please dont come Why do you have to go from Turkey to Europe Turkey is a safe country Stay there Its risky to come Orban saidHundreds of thousands of people fleeing war in Syria Iraq and Afghanistan have overwhelmed Europes capacity to respond in recent months opening stark divisions Some leaders believe that the worlds largest economic bloc  a vast territory of 503million residents  is more than capable of accommodating refugees Others including Hungarys Orban believe the continents population is in a far more delicate stateThe divisions could threaten some of the most basic tenets of the EU an alliance built on the ashes of World WarII in a bid never again to allow such destruction German Chancellor Angela Merkel said this week that a Europe with no internal borders  a key achievement of European unification  could be in question if no solution to the refugee crisis is foundHe warned that the splits emerging during the refugee crisis could do lasting damage to the 28nation alliance which was founded on a spirit of consensus and burdensharingThis is a crucial moment for the European Union Schulz said A deeper split of the union is a risk we cannot excludeOrbans fears are shared by many Eastern European nations which have pushed hard against any attempt to require them to take in asylumseekers Slovakia has said it will accept only Christians In Estonia where fewer than 100 migrants have been resettled police on Thursday were investigating a suspicious earlymorning fire at a dormitory that was housing victims of Syrias warBritain takes in so few refugees from Syria they would fit on a subway trainBut the concerns also extend to Britain There fewer Syrians than would fit in a London subway train have been accepted this year British media reported Thursday that Prime Minister David Cameron would soon announce plans to take in thousands more Syrian refugees a striking turnaround for a leader who a day earlier had said that the answer to the crisis was not simply taking in more and more refugeesElsewhere in Europe the refusals brought mounting anger from leaders who are more sympathetic to the growing crowds of asylumseekersFor a Christian it shouldnt matter what race religion and nationality the person in need represents European Council President Donald Tusk said Thursday launching into Orban before the two met in Brussels Tusk a former prime minister of Poland proposed resettling at least 100000 refugees across EuropeIn France President Franois Hollande said the death of the toddler is a tragedy but its also a call to the European conscience Europe is made of values and principles Images of the childs body lying facedown and partly in the water on a Turkish beach evoked consternation around the worldHollande said he had just reached an agreement with Germany on a proposal for mandatory quotas to more equitably spread refugees across the EU Some European countries are not shouldering their moral obligations he saidMerkel meanwhile said she understood that not every nation was prepared to take on as large a burden as her country was doing But she said it was impossible for Germany Sweden and Austria alone to continue taking in the vast majority of the incoming asylumseekersThe Geneva Convention does not apply only to Germany but also to every state she said referring to the international treaty that requires countries to take in refugees of warOrban has vowed to seal Hungarys borders by Sept15 empowered by emergency measures expected to be approved by the countrys parliament in the coming days The measures would give authorities broad powers to crack down on illegal migrationOutside Budapests elegant stoneandglassfronted station Thursday evening people living in tents and atop worn woolen blankets sprawled across a vast public plaza and into an adjacent subway concourse Tourists carrying frame backpacks slipped into the station entrance past women cradling babies men pacing anxiously and children arguing over the few available toysRefugees expressed a keen awareness that Hungary does not want them  and said the feeling is mutualHungary is a poor country They cant give us the life were looking for They cant even give us food or water said Yahya Lababidi a tanktopwearing 21yearold law student from the northern Syrian province of Idlib We want to go to the rich countriesLababidi said he had been traveling for a month passing along the usual route  through Turkey Greece Macedonia and Serbia  with a plan ultimately to settle in the Netherlands But he said that when he tried to enter the train station in Budapest five days earlier police officers barred his path Since then hes been sleeping on the cold stone of the plazaI escaped from war he said I thought things would be better than thisAs tragedies shock Europe a bigger refugee crisis looms in the Middle EastHungarian leaders have done all they can to stir up popular sentiment against immigrants and refugees said Marta Pardavi a cochair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee a group that offers legal advice to asylumseekers This has become a totally divided issue Friendships break up over thisCritics of the European response said the continents 20thcentury history of dictatorships and wars should instill in it more sympathy for others in needWe are facing a historical moment perhaps one of the biggest the EU has had to face over the last couple of decades said Yves Pascouau director of migration and mobility policies at the Brusselsbased European Policy Center European citizens have fled dictatorships and wars This is a part of our history Weve been able to be protected elsewhere in our countriesWitte reported from Budapest Karla Adam in London contributed to this reportEuropean railways become ground zero for the migrant
