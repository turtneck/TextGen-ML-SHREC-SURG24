The fight for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination appears to be moving into a new more fluid phaseNo longer is the question merely whether or how Donald Trump can be stoppedThe recent rise in the polls of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson  Trumps lowkey stylistic opposite  has shown that the celebrity billionaire may not be the only one who can tap the appetite of many in the partys angry base for an outsiderAnd after Wednesdays chaotic and freewheeling debate there also is a new dynamic on the establishment side of the raceFormer Florida governor Jeb Bushs onceformidable campaign appears to be nearing a state of collapse made worse by his flailing on the stage in ColoradoThat has provided an opening to his onetime ally Sen Marco Rubio of Florida who is getting a new look from the party establishment  an ironic situation given Rubios roots as an insurgent tea party favorite in 2010Marco Rubio now has probably the best shot to emerge as the mainstream alternative to Trump and Carson said Ari Fleischer who was press secretary for President George W BushMore broadly Fleischer who is not committed to any of the 2016 candidates predicted that the GOP is about to enter a condensed version of where it was four years ago where the party is volatile and shopping aroundThat could help Ted Cruz who also made a strong showing in the debate The firebrand senator from Texas widely despised by the Washington Republican hierarchy is looking to nudge out Trump and Carson among voters who are looking for a candidate to supplant the old orderI dont think the party is going to nominate anybody who has not been elected before said Stuart Stevens who was a top strategist for 2012 GOP nominee Mitt RomneyAlso likely to force some clarity in the coming weeks is the calendar The first contest in Iowa is barely more than three months awaySo the focus for all the leading contenders will have to shift from raising their profiles nationally to refining the strategies and organization it will take to put specific states in their columnThe campaign is really in anutsandbolts stage said Trumps campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Its about getting on the ballot organizing and making sure people understand what caucuses are in Iowa and other states and teach them how to participate Its about getting people committed and readyLewandowski said Trumps campaign is already hiring staff for states that do not hold their primaries until MarchOur approach is to execute and meet the criteria to get on the ballot in all 50 states in five territories and in the District of Columbia Thats a fulltime job he added This campaign is doing all of the things necessary for longterm successAt the same time Trump seemed to be moderating and refining his message as he campaigned outside Reno Nev Thursday afternoonWhere he previously has devoted his rallies to slinging insults at his opponents and boasting about his poll numbers Trump focused instead on describing the professional and life experience he would bring to the White HouseHe also cited issues where he claimed to have led before it was a popular thing to do  including opposing the Iraq war and aggressively combating illegal immigrationThats the kind of thinking we need in the country Trump said A lot of the people in the audience maybe in your small way you have that same thinkingBush campaigning in New Hampshire insisted that his struggling candidacy should not be counted out The former Florida governor who is polling in the single digits almost everywhere insisted Were doing fineBut he appeared to acknowledge that he had not helped his prospects with his showing in the debateLook there are two types of politicians There are the talkers and there are the doers Bush told the crowd I wish I could talk as well as some of the people on the stage the big personalities on the stage but Im a doerRubio meanwhile must capitalize  quickly  on whatever interest and momentum may be generated by his debate performance He spent the morning making the rounds of six network and cable television shows and the remainder of the day fundraising in Denver and Chicago He will be in Iowa on FridayOn CBS This Morning Rubio declined to criticize Bush personally and said the differences between the two will be fleshed out in terms of policyIm going to continue to tell people who I am what Im for There are policy differences between us  well discuss those Americans deserve to hear those But Im not going to change my campaign he saidJeb is my friend I have admiration for him Im not running against him Im running for presidentCruz meanwhile is building what GOP insiders say is a strong organization The campaign says that it has 77000 volunteers on the ground with 6000 in the first four voting statesFundraising has also been robust  and was reignited by the debate during which the senator trained his fire on the CNBC moderators and the media A Cruz aide said more than 1million had poured in since Wednesday nights debateThere will be growing pressure on candidates who are getting no traction to get out of the race On Thursday for instance the New York Times editorial board called upon New Jersey Gov Chris Christie to abandon his bidNew Jersey is in trouble and the governor is off pursuing a presidential run thats turned out to be nothing more than a vanity project the paper wrote Mr Christies numbers are in the basement and hes nearly out of campaign cash This is his moment all right to go home and use the rest of his term to clean out the barn as Speaker John Boehner would sayChristie for his part tweeted Cant read the article because I dont have a subscription but I can tell you this  I am not going anywhereRobert Costa in Colorado and
