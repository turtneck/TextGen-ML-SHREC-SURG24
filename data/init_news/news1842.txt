Errol Louis is the host of Inside City Hall a nightly political show on NY1 a New York allnews channel The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authorCNN Years ago when I hosted a daily talkradio show one of the cardinal rules laid down by my program director was to avoid booking guests or taking phone calls from listeners who wanted to debate abortion gay marriage or the death penalty All three issues  and especially abortion  were considered a conversational deadend on which nearly all intelligent adults have already made up their mindsAny sort of abortion debate would inevitably turn into a shoutfest yielding circular arguments bad feelings and bored listenersI thought about that rule of thumb as I read about the elaborate media hoax ginned up by the Center for Medical Progress a rightwing group trying to discredit and defund Planned ParenthoodTaking a page from the falsehoods and selectivelyedited videos that brought about the defunding and bankruptcy of the leftwing advocacy group ACORN the Center for Medical Progress strategy is to create a narrative claim that its videos constitute damning evidence and repeat that story enough times to give politicians the proof they need to attack Planned ParenthoodThat plan appears to have fizzled already with the failure of a Senate vote this week to defund Planned Parenthood But that wont stop the antiabortion advocates who will always see themselves as just one more rally prayer vigil or media hoax away from ultimate victoryDespite the extensive preparation and deceit that went into the plan the hoax wont shift the countrys decadeslong stalemate over abortion by so much as a millimeter As it says in the book of Ecclesiastes What has been will be again what has been done will be done again there is nothing new under the sunBy law women getting abortions can voluntarily donate the tissue from that procedure to medical research and by law the abortion provider can request nominal reimbursement 30 to 100 in most cases  for saving packing and shipping the tissue to a research firmThe details of the process are enough to trouble anyone nonmedical people dont talk about the price of requesting removing and shipping organs and pieces of flesh from place to place Most of us would freak out if we listened to professionals in the local hospita l funeral home or medical examiners office discuss details of how a dying persons request to have their body parts donated for transplants or scientific research actually gets carried outIt turns out that cadavers livers kidneys eyes and other organs dont walk themselves over to the local hospital or medical school for freeSo lets acknowledge up front that some startling even grisly conversations will inevitably follow when women getting an abortion agree to donate the stem cells and other tissue to scientific research But that doesnt equate to selling body partsTranscripts of the videos created by the Center for Medical Progress show instances of the hoaxers posing as medical middlemen trying to lure Planned Parenthood staffers into talking about how money gets paid to abortion providers who take nominal reimbursements for moving body tissue from clinics to research facilitiesAnd in case after case what emerges is medical professionals highly aware and cognizant of their duty to be careful and ethical about their words and actionsReally their bottom line is they want to break even Every penny they save is just pennies they give to another patient To provide a service the patient wouldnt get says Dr Deborah Nucatola senior director of medical services for Planned Parenthood FederationLater in the same conversation she says were not looking to make money from this Our goal is to keep access available And if we do something that makes a target that just removes access for everybodyAnd later Our goal like I said is to give patients the option without impacting our bottom line The messaging is this should not be seen as a new revenue stream because thats not what it isOn and on it goes in each of these supposedly bombshell videos forming what could be called an inkblot conversation similar to the Rorschach tests in which the viewer looks at an inkblot and describes what picture they seeTo those already convinced that abortions should be safe legal and rare it looks like Planned Parenthood is responsibly doing exactly what a medical provider should People who already want to ban all abortions everywhere will see the conversations as some nefarious trade in baby partsIn other words the videos are less an investigative expose than a mirror in which a divided nation can look at its view on abortion
