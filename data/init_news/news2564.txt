Ted Cruz remains a conservative favorite in 2016 In 2012 the establishment backed his Senate opponent in Texas then Lt Governor David Dewhurst The conservative grassroots backed Cruz and pushed him over the finish line Cruz has since remained a favorite of the grassroots with a continually antagonist relationship with the Republican establishmentIn 2010 Rand Paul before Cruz was a grassroots favorite The Republican Establishment backed his rival Trey Grayson Paul rallied a coalition of conservative grassroots and Ron Paul acolytes to trounce Grayson and win the Kentucky Senate seat Since then Paul has wobbled between maintaining grassroots support and developing establishment support In 2014 for example he backed Mitch McConnell for reelection and has taken an occasional aggressive position to contrast himself from CruzIn the same year Rand Paul won the man who started the major revolt between grassroots activists and party leaders ran It was the Rubio race that really exposed the divide between the base and the leadership The leadership backed then Florida Governor Charlie Crist The grassroots led by former Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina allied with Marco Rubio Activists began urging a boycott of the National Republican Senatorial Committee the Washington group that helps the GOP take the SenateRubio over 2009 rose in the polls from three percent to victory Crist was forced to flee the GOP to the Democratic Party where he has been beclowning himself ever sinceOnce in Washington Rubio remained a favorite of the grassroots until he tried to cut a deal with the Democrats on immigration To his credit he went on Rush Limbaughs program to defend it He made aggressive outreach to conservatives behind the scenes But it hurt him and the deal diedSince then Rubio has been very quiet Behind the scenes he has voted quite often with Senators Cruz and Mike Lee of Utah He has been a voice for fiscal sanity small government and strong foreign policyHe is also one of the kindest and most approachable men in Washington He would rather talk football than politics He would rather be with his wife and kids than at a fundraising event or Washington social partyMonday Rubio will declare his candidacy for the presidency of the United States Cruz and Paul have gotten the attention so far All three of these conservative senators the grassroots revolutionaries are announcing ahead of the smorgasbord of governors and other would be Republican contenders Rubios path to the stage in Miami today explains why he might be better positioned than Cruz or Paul to make some headwayCruz remains the conservative grassroots darling They see him as the purest conservative candidate and he probably is If Cruz starts making deals to garner establishment support however he potentially sees his base collapse with a sense of betrayal Cruz thinks he has the base firmly on his side That is usually the moment the ground begins to softenPaul has ceded the conservative grassroots to Cruz and has set about reorganizing his fathers coalition Many conservative grassroots though they sympathize with Paul on fiscal and civil libertarian issues murmur in aggravated tones that Paul backed McConnell in 2014 and did not back Ted Cruzs efforts to defund ObamaCare in 2013 Instead Paul used that to try to contrast himself as an adult in the room versus Cruz and the grassroots Then there are his national security issues which give a lot of the right heartburnRubio however is the original Tea Party candidate His candidacy united the grassroots against the leadership and he won The Washington crowd convinced themselves he could not win but the grassroots proved they could pick a winner Rubio was the firstWhile Cruz and Paul began forging coalitions Rubio worked to not undermine his relations with the grassroots while not antagonizing the establishment His immigration compromise hurt him but he seeks the nomination in an party that nominated both John McCain and Mitt Romney two men to the left of Rubio on immigrationMonday in Miami Marco Rubio will declare his candidacy for the presidency and of the three conservative Senators to run he is most likely the Goldilocks of the bunch He is not too tied to the grassroots to antagonize the establishment He is not too tied to the civil libertarians to antagonize the conservatives And he has not gone out of his way to reject the base of grassroots supporters who got him elected in order to curry favor with the leadershipHe strikes the right balance He has also been so sufficiently off the radar by design for so long that many donors and primary voters will want to listen again to the man who united the right to beat Charlie Crist and the establishment in 2010They may like what they hearErick Erickson is a Fox News contributor He is host of Erick on the Radio and foundereditor of The Resurgent He is the founder of RedStatecom Follow him on Twitter EWErickson
