In 1960 Americans wereasked whether they would be pleased displeased or unmoved if their son or daughter married a member of the other political partyRespondents reacted with a shrug Only 5 percent of Republicans and only 4 percent of Democrats said they would be upset by the crossparty union On the list of things you might care about in childs partner  are they kind smart successful supportive  which political party they voted for just didnt rateFast forward to 2008 The polling firm YouGov asked Democrats and Republicans the same question  and got very different results This time 27 percent of Republicans and 20 percent of Democrats said they would be upset if their son or daughter married a member of the opposite party In 2010 YouGov asked the question again this time 49 percent of Republicans and 33 percent of Democrats professed concern at interparty marriageFor Shanto Iyengar director of Stanfords political communications lab the marriage polls were yet more evidence that something important was changing in American politicsThe big institutions and broad outlines of our political system have been so stable for so long that it makes it hard for people to see when the tectonic plates of American politics are actually shiftingTheres been a Democratic Party and a Republican Party for most of the countrys history and theyve always bickered so its easy to assume  particularly in a country with a short historical memory  that the partisanship we see now is simply how its always beenBut Iyengar was coming to believe that todays political differences were fundamentally different from yesterdays political differences the nature of American political partisanship he worried was mutating into something more fundamental and more irreconcilable than what it had been in the pastPolitical scientists have mainly studied polarization as an ideological phenomenon  in this view party polarization is really another term for political disagreement and more polarization simply meant more severe disagreements But its hard to find the evidence that the disagreements among ordinary Americans have really become so much more intenseIf you look at Americans positions on the issues they are much closer to the center than their elected representatives Iyengar says The people who end up getting elected are super extreme but the voters are notBut even as American voters remained relatively centrist they seemed to be getting angrier and more fearful of the other sideAfter every election researchers ask voters an almost endless series of questions creating a rich record of why Americans vote the way they do The result is called the American National Election Survey and beginning in the 1980s it began to show something puzzlingWhat caught Iyengars eye was a section of the survey known as the thermometer The thermometer asks people to rate their feelings toward the two political parties on a scale of 1 to 100 where 1 is cold and negative and 100 is warm and positive Iyengar noticed that since the 1980s Republicans feelings towards the Democratic Party and Democrats feelings towards the Republican Party had dropped off a cliffIn 1980 voters gave the opposite party a 45 on the thermometer  not as high as the 72 they gave their own party but a pretty decent number all the sameAfter 1980 though the numbers began dropping By 1992 the opposing party was down to 40 by 1998 it had fallen to 38 in 2012 it was down to 30 Meanwhile partisans views towards their own parties had remained pretty much unchanged  that 72 from 1980 had only fallen to 70 by 2012Iyengars hypothesis was that rising political polarization was showing something more fundamental than political disagreement  it was tracking the transformation of party affiliation into a form of personal identity that reached into almost every aspect of our livesIf he was right then party affiliation wasnt simply an expression of our disagreements it was also becoming the cause of them If Democrats thought of other Democrats as their tribe and of Republicans as a hostile tribe and vice versa then the consequences would stretch far beyond politics  into things like say marriageAnd the data was everywhere Polls looking at the difference between how Republicans viewed Democrats and how Democrats viewed Republicans now showed that partisans were less accepting of each other than white people were of black people or than black people were of white peopleBut there was no way partisanship  an identity we choose and that didnt matter much to us 50 years ago  could possibly have become a cleavage in American life as deep as race right That seemed crazySo Iyengar decided to test itThe experiment was simple Working with Dartmouth College political scientist Sean Westwood Iyengar asked about 1000 people to decide between the rsums of two high school seniors who were competing for a scholarshipThe resumes could differ in three ways First the senior could have either a 35 or 40 GPA second the senior could have been the president of the Young Democrats or Young Republicans club third the senior could have a stereotypically AfricanAmerican name and have been president of the AfricanAmerican Student Association or could have a stereotypically EuropeanAmerican nameThe point of the project was to see how political and cues affected a nonpolitical task  and to compare the effect with race The results were startlingWhen the rsum included a political identity cue about 80 percent of Democrats and Republicans awarded the scholarship to their copartisan This held true whether or not the copartisan had the highest GPA  when the Republican student was more qualified Democrats only chose him 30 percent of the time and when the Democrat was more qualified Republicans only chose him 15 percent of the timeThink about that for a moment When awarding a college scholarship a task that should be completely nonpolitical  Republicans and Democrats cared more about the political party of the student than the students GPA As Iyengar and Westwood wrote Partisanship simply trumped academic excellenceIt also trumped race When the candidates were equally qualified about 78 percent of African Americans chose the candidate of the same race and 42 percent of European Americans did the same When the candidate of the other race had a higher GPA 45 percent of African Americans chose him and 71 percent of European Americans chose himBut Iyengar and Westwood wondered whether these results would really hold outside the laboratory setting After all the studys participants knew their answers were being judged by the researchers Perhaps discriminating against members of the other party was socially acceptable in a way discriminating against people of the other race simply wasnt In other words perhaps people are willing to show their partisan bias whereas they hide their racial bias and that was what was behind the resultsSo Iyengar and Westwood came up with another test  a test that would be much harder to foolTaking an implicitassociation test is a humbling experience Your job as the test taker is to hit a letter on your keyboard when certain word and images flash together The instructions are to go as fast as you can but the fastest you can go is sluggish compared with the pace of the program You get nervous your finger stumbling over the keys hitting the wrong ones And the whole time youre doing it you know youre being judged and you realize with a sickening certainty that the verdict isnt going to be goodThe point of IATs is to measure the snap judgments your brain makes at speeds faster than conscious thought Mountains of psychological research shows that these judgments are powerful  that much of what we consciously think is an afterthefact rationalization for the instant judgment we made before we had time to think IATs are meant to expose those judgmentsThe test is grounded in studies of racism Researchers will ask subjects to pair positive words with black and white faces and see which they have more trouble doing The underlying insight is that the task is easier to complete when it aligns with peoples automatic unconscious reaction than when it isnt  youre faster when you can go with instinct then when you have to suppress it Study after study shows that IATs are at least somewhat predictive of realworld racial bias They have since been extended to measure bias in gender age weight and moreIyengar and Westwoods idea was simple Why not use an IAT to measure partisan bias tooSo they built one And the results were fascinating But before we run through them Iyengar and Westwood kindly shared their code with us and so you can take the testhere or at the top of this article and see how strong your bias isThe results showed as you might expect that Democrats exhibit an automatic bias against Republicans and vice versa What was surprising was that the bias partisans exhibited for their outgroup exceeded the bias white participants showed for black people or that black participants showed for white people According to the test Americans are more automatically partisan than they are automatically racist If you want to know your own results on the racism test you can take a version meant to test racial biashereThis was to Westwood a bit of a shock To be honest I didnt expect this to work at all he says The common story is most Americans dont care about politics they dont understand politics they dont understand policy So you wouldnt expect Americans to have strong preferences Thats where I startedTogether the two experiments suggest that partisanship now extends beyond politics  its becoming a fundamental identity in American life and may well lead to discrimination in completely apolitical contextsI asked two other political scientists  John Sides and Danny Hayes both of George Washington University  whether they bought Iyengar and Westwoods data Both said they did though they noted that opportunities for partisan discrimination are less common than opportunities for racial or gender discrimination if for no other reason than partisanship is less visibleStill the impulse to discriminate against the outparty is real The more partisanship becomes a social identity  and I think this is as true today as its been in modern American politics  the more we should expect people to engage in ingroup favoritism and outgroup discrimination Hayes saidIyengars hypothesis is that partisan animosity is one of the few forms of discrimination that contemporary American society not only permits but actively encouragesPolitical identity is fair game for hatred he says Racial identity is not Gender identity is not You cannot express negative sentiments about social groups in this day and age But political identities are not protected by these constraints A Republican is someone who chooses to be Republican so I can say whatever I want about themYou can see an example when you look at the media Westwood observes There are no major cable channels devoted to making people of other races look bad But there are cable channels that seem devoted to making members of the other party look bad The media has become tribal leaders he says Theyre telling the tribe how to identify and behave and were following alongIyengar and Westwoods research is a fundamental challenge to the way we like to believe American politics works A world where we wont give an outparty high schooler with a better GPA a nonpolitical scholarship is not a world in which were going to listen to politicians of the other side on emotional controversial issues  even if theyre making good arguments that are backed by the factsThe media is telling the tribe how to identify and behave and were following alongIyengars initial insight was that political polarization might be less about policy than it is about identity and his research more than proves it The old theory was political parties came into existence to represent deep social cleavages he says But now party politics has taken on a life of its own  now it is the cleavageThat changes the playbook for cynical presidential candidates policymakers pundits and so onThe major takehome here is its relatively easy to score points by attacking the opposition and touting the goodness of ones own party says Westwood If youre trying to get the largest return from voters it would make sense for politicians to try to activate social identity rather than focus on policyWinning an argument at least when youre talking to copartisans is less about persuasion than about delegitimization  the savvy move isnt to try to build a better case than the other side but to make clear that the other side is the other sideWestwood is quick to note that the comparison to racism doesnt mean that partisanship is somehow worse than racism more pervasive or more damaging Its easier to see  and thus discriminate  against people based on their skin color than their partisanship for instance And as Jene DesmondHarris haswritten political beliefs are a choice with moral implications while race is notJudging someone on whether they support gay marriage universal healthcare or gun laws is far different than judging someone on the color of their skinWhat Iyengar and Westwoods research shows however is that partisanship is no longer just a political phenomenon Party and ideology have become powerful forms of personal identity and the way they inform our lives  who we listen to who we help even who we love  now stretches far beyond the political realm
