Washington DC  In another devastating blow to the 4th Amendment on Monday the Supreme Court ruled that evidence of an alleged crime can be used against a defendant even if police did something inappropriate or even illegal to obtain it In a split 53 decision the justices voted to reinstate the drugrelated convictions of Joseph Edward Strieff In the case of Strieff he was illegally detained during a concededly unconstitutional detention which eventually led to the discovery of drugs inside his vehicle In Strieffs case a trial court judge later found that the officer did not have enough evidence to initially stop and question him But the judge ruled that Strieffs subsequent arrest on an outstanding traffic warrant justified the search  implying that the use of criminal behavior to catch criminal behavior is just The Utah Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that the drug evidence was admissible at trial but in a moment of logic the Utah Supreme Court last year reversed that decision The Utah Supreme Court noted in its January 2015 decision that the case presented a gap of substantial significance in terms of prior rulings by the US Supreme Court on Fourth Amendment issues and that other courts that have addressed the issue have come to substantially different conclusions regarding search and seizure law The Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule allows criminal defendants to suppress fruit of the poisonous tree that is evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure that violates the Fourth Amendment The reason this rule exists is due to the obvious conflict of interests in cops breaking the law to enforce the law However thanks to Mondays ruling by the Supreme Court that is exactly what will happen now Police have essentially been given a free pass to violate the rights of individuals  just so long as they find evidence of a crime On Monday the logic applied by the Utah Supreme Court in 2015 was thrown to the wayside in a handout to the police state Given the reality of the militarized police state rising up from the horrors of the war on drugs the fact that cops can now legally act illegally to bust people for possessing arbitrary substances is chilling As if breaking the law wasnt enough prior to this ruling p olice were no longer required to even give the appearance of an understanding of the laws theyre tasked with enforcing thanks to a recent court decision surpassing even the veritable green light previously granted in Heien v North Carolina  In the Heien case the Supreme Court ruled a police officers reasonable mistake of law gives rise to reasonable suspicion that justifies a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment A motorists broken tail light caused an officer to make a traffic stop  during which evidence of a separate violation of the law was discovered in the vehicle But in North Carolina a broken tail light wasnt illegal thus not sufficient cause to justify the stop  nor the arrests stemming from it lawyers argued because that would be a violation of unreasonable searches and seizures However the Supreme Court ruled the officers ignorance of the law essentially didnt matter  effectively allowing police around the country the ability to make stops if they reasonably believe the cause for the stop is legal Plainly police can stop and search you despite ignorance of the law Now in US v Shelton Barnes et al  a case that seemed to slip by largely unnoticed  even that flimsy justification has been deemed too constricting of police power and police ignorance can actually be used against you in a trial On Monday Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in dissent that the decision in Utah vs Edward Joseph Strieff is a blow to constitutional rights The court today holds that the discovery of a warrant for an unpaid parking ticket will forgive a police officers violation of your Fourth Amendment rights Sotomayor wrote Sotomayors dissent was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan Now police need not understand the law or even abide by the law  to enforce the law In what world is this considered acceptable Share yeah were fucked and here comes the revolution kiljoy616 True that many will be screwed but there will be no revolution best to learn how to navigate this new world you live in Gene U sheep theres an actual revolution going on right now its just not televised so sheep like you stay ignorant WolfPACcom is a Constitutional amendment by the American people to get the money out of politics To end the oligarchy 4 states have already passed it 11 more to go Pay attention sheep they got you by the balls Even this site is ignoring it makes me wonder ThomasJefferson LMAO Do you REALLY think that will make any difference Hell theres a a couple of movements that actually if they were to be carried through with would go further toward fixing the problem but some of the state reps that have pledged their support are the very ones that are a MAJOR part of the problem Tabbytha I seriously doubt they will succeed in the long run Sheep Whats good for the goose is good for the gander Greg Geitner copsucker is a term used to describe a spineless animal that believes law enforcement should always be obeyed ThomasJefferson People dont have the balls to revolt anymore Theyr cross their fingers and HOPE that the sht dont hit the fan in their own little world The REALLY stupid ones think it will never happen to them ether because of some false sense of superiority or because they think that so long as they keep their nose planted firmly in their Masters Assthat nothing bad will come to them via The Pigs Nothing but dumb luck can save ANYONE from the Gestapo now LexRex Mann Are you organizing an overthrow Email me Jude Rene Montarsi httpwwwgarynorthcompublic12619printcfm Gene Could you provide links Sometimes you go off the rails with your propaganda Like the story of the DEA declassifying cannabis they came out and said that wasnt true I do my own research guess Im whining for convenience Richard Brooks httpwwwmsnbccommsnbcsupremecourtrefinesrulesgoverningpoliceconduct avelworldcreator Heres the problem They guy already had a warrant even if the officer hadnt used that fact in the stop and search Sadly the Court has said such preexisting circumstances can cover a multitude of ills In short he had grounds to do an arrest and a search already even if he wasnt aware of their existence Its bullshit but there it is Betty Anne Emery Rubendall Do you mean if cop had run his tags the warrant would have shown I wonder why he didnt avelworldcreator Doesnt sound like the cop in this case was bright enough to follow procedure or more likely he didnt care and just wanted to fuck with someone Even more likely it was a combination of both He simply got lucky William Keen In Obamas World of course But what difference does any of this make YOU act like Executive Orders are valid This website quotes them as being Lawful Orders just because a POtuS signs them Obviously the Constitution for the United States of America has no meaning anywhere anymore It doesnt matter which Amendment you ignore when the OnTheStreet Militarily Trained and equipped cop is ignorant of the law in their jurisdiction and the courts allow that Take out the KingsofCorruption US Supreme Court the BAR Association 13th Amendment violation and the local goons and lets START OVER ThomasJefferson What an IDIOT Dude the ground work was laid for this trashing of the constitution by Ronald Reagan And NOW idiots think that DUMP is the answer For all the good a president can do people better wake up and vote Libertarian Gary Johnson Any thing else is another MAJOR blow to the constitution In fact its probably trashed beyond anything less than a revolution will fix already LexRex Mann Why call him an idiot He never mentions Trump You are the one taken in by the fraud of election Dont you get it Voting is a waste of time Who counts the votes Why is it done in secret Do you really trust them to count votes accurately Again Take out the KingsofCorruption US Supreme Court the BAR Association 13th Amendment violation and the local goons and lets START OVER ThomasJefferson Nope he doesnt mention mention Trump The comment wasnt aimed at him per se Im so used to reading comments from the sheeple that are guzzling Dump Koolaid it was I suppose what is known in military parlance as a preemptive strike While I agree with you in theory 100 for the moment I think the vote thing for what its worth if enough people would break the chains that bind their minds and vote contrary to programming would upset the proverbial applecart Hell a liberty leaning candidate may not become president but enough people might wake up to the very facts you made mention of and at last begin a meaningful revolt Sorry I cant condense where this could lead and dontr really have the time at the moment to follow through with his concept but youre a sharp guy just think what a little enlightenment and the motivation of people of real action could accomplish Its how AMERICA came into existence to begin with The Federal Farmer Yes start over because we need a government right How about we just dissolve the federal government and replace it again with 50 individual sovereign governmentsto start with jonn So the SCOTUS has to protect cops over protecting The Constitution or American Citizens because cops are too stupid to understand The Constitution or local laws vera4576 I currently make close to 60008000 bucks month from

psychopaths who have manipulated and bought themselves into this position This is what monopoly capitalism evolves to the unquenchable desire for money and power at any cost to the human race They should all be hung on the White House steps Our days are numbered unless we rise up jonn I dont think real Americans are going to let this Country fall completely into a police state I believe there will be a event so horrific by the govt that the million man march will happen and these elected officials will be dragged out of their ivory towers and be tarred and feathered and run out of town Too many normal Americans too many veterans too many freedom loving people for the govt to completely control gininitaly Knock wood altho Ive been waiting 10 long years watching our former rights disappear one after another and still too many are sparring with the illusions of enemies manufactured for us instead the real ones right here in the highest seats of our government LexRex Mann Exactly even as truthers gow in numbers we become divided by things like whether the earth is flat whether to vote for Sanders or Trump whether to hate Muslims or not etc etc etc Theyll have us killing each other before we get to the steps of Congress Weve been divided and conquered I keep telling people posting these memes on facebook to forget differences like these and stay focused on the real enemy but sadly not many seem to be listening gininitaly Absolutely I do the same and see as you have that that insidious flat screen in everyones homes is the grand distractor and brain washer par excellence which is why 6 companies own 90 of the media all preaching fear fake enemies and outright lies But too many are still in denial since Sept 11 2001 as if the obvious didnt really happen as theyve been told it did that somehow America will just bounce back and be itself again Foolish pipe dream and dangerous one that will enslave us that noose is tightening everyday as this article just proved As Hitler said If you tell a big enough lie and tell it frequently enough it will be believed So a war mongering murdering Imperialist gov that created terror in the first place and has now allowed our police to terrorize its own citizens by throwing a traitorous SCOTUS into the mix whittling whittling away at our former Constitutional protections and what do you get National and global chaos like America has never witnessed in its short but intense life Fiona Clark I couldnt have said it better myself People are waking up but way to slowly Does something actually have to hit them in the face before they can see it Joseph Edward Bodden I voted for Bernie They said I would be wasting my vote But please explain to me how my failing to vote for the only decent candidate and voting instead for a choice of nutter or criminal is NOT wasting my vote And how did the DNC get the power to rule out Bernie as a candidate I cannot find it in the Constitution BanishedJester Real Americans already allowed the full insertion of the police state when we allowed the government to form SWAT teams and then to use them to break into peoples homes for allegedly using plants Plants We are already fucked and it is time for us to begin dealing with the treason that abounds Cops lawyers judges legislatures should all hang for what we have allowed them to do Nothing will change with any less effort Nunya They dont have to know or follow the laws it is called law EFORCEMENT Just do that Frank Welsh Utahs Supreme Court is an Administrative Branch the real Common Law Supreme Court
