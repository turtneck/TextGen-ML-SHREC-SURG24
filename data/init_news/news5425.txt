patrick martin  barry grey wswsorg Political warfare explodes in Washington 31 October 2016 J ust a week before Election Day the crisis gripping the American ruling class and its state marked by intractable and bitter internal conflicts has erupted into open political warfare Last Fridays letter from Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey to Congress announcing new investigative steps in the probe of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton itself a manifestation of the crisis has brought the underlying tensions to the boiling point It has exposed raging conflicts within the FBI and more broadly the national security apparatus as a whole Comeys cryptic letter acknowledged that the FBI has not actually reviewed a new batch of emails that appear to be pertinent to its previous investigation into Clintons use of a private email server for official business while she was secretary of state The agency he wrote cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant This astonishing admission makes all the more extraordinary Comeys decision to make the discovery of the new emails a public issue only eleven days before the election In a rapidfire series of developments this weekend Justice Department officials revealed that they had opposed Comeys decision to send the letter arguing that it violated a longstanding principle that no Justice Department or FBI action that might impact on a candidate should be announced within 60 days of an election The Clinton campaign and congressional Democrats lashed out at Comey for the timing of the letter At a campaign rally in Daytona Beach Florida Clinton said Comeys action is not just strange its unprecedented She also tweeted that FBI Director Comey bowed to partisan pressure suggesting that the letter was an effort to appease congressional Republican leaders opposed to Comeys determination last July that there was no basis for criminal charges against Clinton over her use of a private email server Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid sent a letter to Comey suggesting that he had violated the law forbidding government employees to use their official positions to influence the result of an election I am writing to inform you that my office has determined that these actions may violate the Hatch Act he wrote Through your partisan actions you may have broken the law He added that Comey had demonstrated a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information with what appears to be clear intent to aid one political party over another because he had made public the renewed FBI interest in Clintons emails but was silent on what Reid called explosive information supposedly connecting Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Russian government officials Here Reid was resorting to the Russiabaiting that has been the Clinton campaigns main response to the publication by WikiLeaks of tens of thousands of emails and other documents sent or received by campaign chairman John Podesta including devastating information on Bill Clintons use of the Clinton Foundation to obtain lucrative speaking engagements with corporations and business associations Campaign spokesmen have refused to discuss the contents of the emails claiming that they were hacked by Russian government agents and then handed over to WikiLeaks to damage Clinton and help Trump NBC News reported Sunday that the FBI has now obtained a search warrant to go through all 650000 emails found on the laptop of former congressman Anthony Weiner the estranged husband of Clintons closest aide Huma Abedin Weiner is under FBI investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl The Wall Street Journal gave details in a story posted on its web site Sunday afternoon of the explosive internal crisis within the FBI that led to Comeys letter to Congress By this account there has been a fierce battle within the FBI and between the FBI and the Justice Department not only over the Clinton email investigation but over separate investigations involving four FBI field offices New York Washington DC Los Angeles and Little Rock Arkansas into the operations of the Clinton Foundation AG Lynch A Democrat apparatchik like the rest of the top tier of the Democratic party mafia and typical of the Black misleaders that ice African American radicalism in a conflicted age More than eight months ago FBI agents presented plans for a more aggressive investigation of the foundation to career prosecutors in the Justice Department only to have the proposal blocked on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence The FBI offices nonetheless continued their investigations which were intensified after the Clinton email investigation was wound up in July The Journal report suggests that either a substantial faction within the FBI was convinced that top FBI officials were covering up criminal activities on the part of Hillary and Bill Clinton or the FBI dissidents were politically motivated to use agency resources to undermine Hillary Clintons presidential campaign or both When top officials in the FBI and Justice Department opposed these efforts open rebellion followed expressed in leaks to the Wall Street Journal centrally targeting FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe whose wife was an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for state senate in Virginia last year According to some press reports Comey sent his letter to Congress last week because he was convinced the information would become public anyway through further leaks by FBI subordinates The open warfare engulfing Washington on the eve of a presidential election reveals that the entire political system and the state apparatus itself are riven by tensions and conflicts so deep and bitter that they cannot be contained within the traditional framework of bourgeois elections Fueling these tensions is the convergence of crises on the economic geopolitical internal political and social fronts The US and world economy remain mired in stagnation more than eight years after the 2008 Wall Street crash and there are growing fears that central bank policies designed to buttress the banks and drive up stock prices are leading to a new financial disaster The economic crisis is fueling social anger and alienation from the entire political system as reflected in different ways in the mass support for the antiWall Street campaign of the selfstyled socialist Bernie Sanders and the America first pseudopopulist campaign of Donald Trump Twentyfive years of unending war and fifteen years of the war on terror have failed to secure US hegemony in the Middle East and only heightened fears within the ruling elite that US imperialism is losing ground to rivals such as Russia and China The disarray of US policy in Syria in particular has led to bitter conflicts and recriminations over US policy and demands for a major escalation of military violence not only in Syria but throughout the Middle East These are combined with calls for a more aggressive confrontation with Russia and China The great danger is that these conflicts are being fought out behind the backs of the working class by different factions of the same reactionary ruling class Unless the working class intervenes as an independent political and revolutionary force fighting for its own interests in opposition to all parties and factions of the capitalist class the crisis will inevitably result in ever more rightwing policies at home and ever wider wars abroad leading inexorably to a new world war The capitalist twoparty system offers only two reactionary alternatives the fascistic billionaire Trump who demands a vast increase in military spending and authoritarian methods of rule and the multimillionaire Clinton the favorite of Wall Street and the militaryintelligence apparatus who would continue and escalate the rightwing policies of the Obama administration All factions of the ruling elite agree on concealing the implications of the world capitalist crisis from working people Hence the degraded character of the bourgeois election campaign with any serious discussion of the social crisis and the war danger drowned out by media sensationalism over a succession of sex scandals and antiRussian propaganda The Socialist Equality Party entered the 2016 elections to prepare the working class for the political convulsions that have already begun even before the ballots are counted on Election Day Our candidates Jerry White for president and Niles Niemuth for vice president have consistently warned that the capitalist campaigns are aimed at concealing the crisis and disarming working people The SEP election campaign is not fundamentally about votes but about building a political leadership in the working class for the great struggles to come Patrick Martin and Barry Grey The FBI intervenes in the 2016 election Dateline 29 October 2016 I n an extraordinary and unprecedented action the Federal Bureau of Investigation has stepped into the 2016 presidential campaign only 11 days before Election Day sending a letter to Congress announcing new investigative steps related to Hillary Clintons use of a private email server The threeparagraph letter by FBI Director James Comey to eight congressional committees on Friday is remarkably vague It states that in connection with an unrelated case the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation of Clintons personal email server which Comey notes he had previously told Congress was completed He states that he has agreed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information as well as to assess their importance to our investigation He acknowledges that the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant The obvious question that arises is why given the fact that the FBI has no idea whether these additional emails contain any significant information relative to the Clinton email case the agency should make them a public issue within days of the election Media commentators noted that the letter violates a longstanding informal FBI ban on making politically sensitive announcements within 60 days of a US election Following the report of Comeys letter the news media citing unnamed federal law enforcement officials said the emails in question were found on a laptop computer shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband former Representative Anthony Weiner Weiner is under FBI investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl Abedin announced her separation from Weiner earlier this year after the latest episode involving Weiner and sexually explicit Internet activity became public Comeys letter was hailed by Donald Trump and Republican Party spokesmen as tantamount to an official reopening of the FBI investigation and rescinding of the decision announced by Comey in July that no charges would be brought against the Democratic presidential candidate Clinton spoke to the press briefly Friday evening demanding that the FBI provide more information about the substance of what it was reviewing including whether there was any connection to her use of a private email server She pointed out that more than 15 million people have already voted and that many millions more will be going to the polls over the next week as early voting continues In response to questions she indicated that the FBI has not contacted her and that she first learned of the letter through the media It is at this point impossible to determine with precision the motivation behind Comeys letter and the political forces for which he is speaking However his attempt to present the letter as a politically disinterested response to the discovery of new information lacks any credibility This direct intervention into the election by the top policeintelligence agency can only be an expression of deep crisis and profound tensions within the American ruling class and the state The election as a whole has been dominated by the growth of social anger and antiestablishment sentiment yet it has ended in a contest between two rightwing representatives of the richest 1 percent who are despised by huge sections of the electorate It has plumbed the depths of political debasement on the part of both candidatesthe fascistic billionaire Trump seeking to channel discontent along the most rightwing chauvinist and racist channels the multimillionaire Clinton relying on sex scandals and a McCarthyite attack on Trump as an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin to bury incriminating revelations of corruption and lying and to swing public opinion behind a policy of military escalation and confrontation with nucleararmed Russia The entire process has been surrounded by an aura of violence and a breakdown of public confidence in the political system It has unfolded under conditions of deepening economic crisis mounting international tensions and worsening crises for US imperialism around the world ie the ongoing debacle of Washingtons war for regime change in Syria the signs of disarray in the antiChinese pivot to Asia the emergence of open conflicts with imperialist allies in Europe particularly Germany The convergence of these crises is generating bitter conflicts within the American ruling class over policy questions magnified by fears of a rising tide of social opposition at home Whether the intention of Comeys letter was to inflict fatal damage to Clintons candidacy shore up endangered Republican majorities in the Senate and House or fire a shot across the bow against an incoming Clinton administration it makes clear that the next administration will be mired in crisis from the day it takes officeif gte mso

data1oshapelayoutxmlendif One former Justice Department official suggested that Comey was under intense pressure from within the FBI over his previous declaration that no competent prosecutor would bring charges against Clinton over her use of the private server If true this means that sections of the federal police agency are in open revolt against the candidate who may shortly become their nominal commanderinchief The FBI intervention on the eve of the 2016 election represents an acceleration of a trend in US politics that first came to the surface in the series of Republicanled investigations into the Bill Clinton administration culminating in his impeachment in 1998 This was followed by the stolen election of 2000 when the Supreme Court intervened and by a 54 majority halted the recounting of ballots in Florida in order to award the White House to George W Bush the loser in the popular vote The twoparty system in the United States has always been an instrument of class rule dominated by corporate America The unprecedented growth of social inequality over the past four decades has widened the gulf between the political system and the great majority of the population More and more official political life revolves around palace intrigues in which the media and the militaryintelligence apparatus play critical roles The methods of scandalmongering calculated leaks and political stink bombs prevail One thing is clear none of these strokes and counterstrokes between rival capitalist factions has anything to do with defending the democratic rights and social interests of working people As far as the capitalist twoparty system is concerned the American people are merely an object of manipulation to be stampeded by demagogy and scandal Patrick
