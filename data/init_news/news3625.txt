The Republican presidential nominees claim that the election is being rigged against him represents the most outlandish moment yet in a campaign devoted to dismantling political normsTrump might not be the first candidate to feel nefarious forces are moving to keep him from the White House  presidential elections have occasionally been disputed after votes are counted and have often been marred by accusations of dark instruments of fraud such as the dead casting votesBut Trumps claim three weeks before Election Day  as many voters are already going to the polls  that the race is being being deliberately stacked against him by a fearful political establishment flies in the face of historical precedent And should he lose it threatens the legitimacy of those left to govern after the most anarchic election in modern historyRemember we are competing in a rigged election Trump said at a Wisconsin rally Monday night They even want to try and rig the election at the polling booths where so many cities are corrupt and voter fraud is all too commonHis accusations alone experts say could inflict longstanding damage on the US political system itself by eroding trust in the probity of the electoral processEver since a weary George Washington rode home to Mount Vernon in 1797 American democracy has rested on a cherished principle the transfer of power from an outgoing president to a successor widely seen as legitimateThe most important thing in the system is that the winners win and the losers lose said Mark Braden former chief counsel of the Republican National Committee Almost as important as that is that the rational people that support the loser believes that the winner wonOne of Trumps GOP primary rivals Florida Sen Marco Rubio rejected Trumps claims that the election is being riggedTrumps accusations come as his campaign slips further behind Democrat Hillary Clinton three weeks from Election Day prompting him to deal in ever more conspiratorial claims that shield him from culpability in his own fate And there is every sign that his most loyal supporters accept his warnings that a horror show is taking place and that the election could be stolenHistory has seen accusations of electionswaying before from John F Kennedys henchmen allegedly cheating Richard Nixon out of the presidency in 1960 to the infamous hanging chads of the Florida recount in 2000 But Trumps repeated claims that the election is already being rigged are the electoral equivalent of the nuclear optionEssentially he is saying in advance that the election is illegitimate rather than challenging the results after signs of wrongdoing once the votes are countedHistory is replete with illegal things going on during elections but at this point in the 21st Century to make the grandiose statement like Trump is  that the election is rigged is bogus  it is antidemocratic spirit it is antiAmerican at its core said CNN historian Douglas Brinkley from Rice University on CNNs New Day on MondayOhios Republican Secretary of State Jon Husted told CNNs Carol Costello on Monday that his state makes it easy to vote but hard to cheatI can assure Donald Trump that I am in charge of elections in Ohio and theyre not going to be rigged Ill make sure of that Husted saidBut Trump has been long been warning that the election could be stacked against himHe claimed that the Republican primary race could be rigged against him and used the idea that he and his followers were being persecuted by the political establishment as a device to motivate his political baseHe has returned to the theme of a venomous Washington political establishment rigging the vote on and off for weeks He claimed in West Palm Beach on Thursday that the media was in lockstep with Clintons campaign as part of a global conspiracy by fearful elites to make her presidentBut his accusations hit a new intensity late last week and over the weekendThe election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary  but also at many polling places  SAD Trump tweeted on SundayOf course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on So naive Trump added on MondayTrump has also raised doubts about the integrity of the election in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania and has several times urged supporters to show up at polling places to ensure no fraud is perpetrated  an order that appears to risk voter intimidationBut Trump ally Rudolph Giuliani the former mayor of New York City said on CNNs State of the Union on Sunday that he would have to be a moron to assume that there would be no electoral fraud in Democraticrun cities like Philadelphia and ChicagoYet theres no actual evidence that Trumps claims about 2016 are true and the billionaire has certainly not provided any suggesting a massive fraud  unknown in US history  is under wayWe have had corruption in the 19th century  there have been controversies when elections were contested and decided in Congress such as in 1824 said Princeton University history professor Julian Zelizer referring to a vote ultimately decided by the House of Representatives The presidency was awarded to John Quincy Adams after none of the four candidates won a majority of the electoral votesBut it is virtually impossible in 2016 to rig an entire election Zelizer said It is decentralized its fragmented and there is very little evidence that this could happenSeveral recent academic and government studies have also shown infinitesimal levels of electoral fraud despite claims by Republicans that it is widespread  an effort liberals say is part of a widespread campaign to restrict poll access that could disproportionately disqualify minority voters who tend to back DemocratsMeanwhile pressure is rising on key Republicans to repudiate Trumps claimsHouse Speaker Paul Ryan released a statement through a spokeswoman on Saturday saying that he is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrityBut neither Ryan nor Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell have spoken out in personFor fraud to take place Republican officials who are in charge of the voting systems in swing states like Ohio Florida Iowa and North Carolina would have to turn a blind eye towards conduct designed to keep their own party nominee from the presidency  or participate in doing soTrumps own running mate Indiana Gov Mike Pence appeared to split with his partner on Sunday We will absolutely accept the results of the election he said on NBCs Meet the PressOn Monday however he suggested that irregularities were a real problem and embraced Trumps notion that the media elite are an extension of the Clinton campaign and therefore also part of the hoodwinkingGiven that Trump has branded himself in politics business and life as the ultimate winner the prospect of a crushing defeat in November on the grandest stage must be a bitter one So prespinning a possible defeat may represent a facesaving way outHe is hedging himself against a loss If he does lose he can say that is a fraud said Jessica LavariegaMonforti chair of the Department of Politics at Pace University New YorkHe might also think a close election is likely and is laying the groundwork for a legal challengeMuch now depends on whether Trump pulls off a comefrombehind victory in which case he will presumably withdraw his accusations of fraud or claims that a loss is the product of widespread electoral fraud  charges that could prompt many Americans to view a Clinton presidency as illegitimateBut should he have second thoughts and choose to fall into line with historical precedent in the dying moments of his campaign he has plenty of examples to look toIn 1960 Nixon chose not to challenge the result even though some advisors wanted him to reasoning that he could damage his own political future and that the fate of the nation was on the lineI want Senator Kennedy to know  and I want all of you to know that certainly if this trend does continue and he does become our next president that he will have my wholehearted support Nixon told supporters on election nightIn 2000 after the Supreme Court closed off his last hope of claiming Florida and a majority of Electoral College votes after a bitter weekslong fight Vice President Al Gore conceded to George W Bush with graceAlmost a century and a half ago Sen Stephen Douglas told Abraham Lincoln who had just defeated him for the presidency Partisan feeling must yield to patriotism Im with you Mr President and God bless you  Gore saidWell in that same spirit I say to Presidentelect Bush that what remains of partisan rancor must now be put aside and may God bless his stewardship of this country Gore saidThe question now after a deeply rancorous election that has cleaved partisan divides ever deeper is whether either Trump or Clinton could summon those words about each other three weeks from Tuesday
