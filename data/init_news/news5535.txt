justice authorities over a multi billion dollar fine Germanys biggest lender earlier posted an unexpected quarterly profit benefiting from a modest rebound in bond trading but failed to dispel the cloud of uncertainty that drove clients to withdraw billions of euros Cryan said on a conference call that the quarter had been overshadowed by talks over the US Department of Justices settlement proposal relating to sales of RMBS residential mortgagebacked securities which had caused uncertainty As well as having an impact on investor and client views of the bank this uncertainty had also taken its toll on financial planning and strategy execution Cryan added Cryan warned Deutsche Bank employees in a letter that the situation will stay difficult for a while and said he was working to finalize the settlement as soon as possible Deutsche Bank would also intensify a major restructuring to counter a deteriorating environment for banking in Europe and elsewhere Cryan said However a top ten shareholder called on the banks management to make deeper cuts in its trading activities Fixed income is still oversized in terms of cost and on group level there are still 10000 staff too many Despite weeks of negative headlines Deutsche was able to announce an unexpected net profit of 278 million euros 303 million in the third quarter lifted by a surge in bond trading that boosted all Wall Street banks This sent its shares to a more than onemonth high but they retreated in line with the market to be down 03 percent Deutsche Banks Chief Financial Officer Marcus Schenck also struck a positive note saying he expects the fourth quarter trading business overall to exceed last years performance SPREADSHEET MYTH Cryan said he was spending at least an hour a day explaining the banks position to clients adding To dispel any myths I dont just sit poring over spreadsheets Negotiations over a 14 billion demand from the US DoJ for misselling toxic mortgagebacked securities before the 20072009 financial crisis have set a bleak backdrop for Cryan Thursdays results gave some insight into how this demand has rocked confidence in Deutsche Bank which plays a critical role in financing some of Germanys biggest companies In retail and wealth management which had assets of almost 440 billion euros clients withdrew 9 billion euros in the third quarter Deutsche Bank revealed Outflows had since abated it said although its global markets trading business was also hit Cryan said the bank had liquidity reserves of 200 billion euros a fall from the more than 215 billion he had outlined on Sept 30 In June the bank had 223 billion euros Deutsche Bank set aside more money for its legal bill for numerous past missteps Litigation reserves rose to 59 billion from 55 billion at the end of June However Deutsche Bank has so far not made a specific proposal for what it would be willing to pay to settle the RMBS case and has therefore not upped its provisions for it It had hoped to settle the case for about 3 billion Revenue grew slightly at 75 billion euros ahead of analysts expectations mainly driven by Deutsches trading while business declined in other operating areas Top down revenues were stronger and the bank is delivering on costs with this quarter being a fourth consecutive one of declining operating expenses analysts at Morgan Stanley noted Its bond trading which has volatile earnings and tough capital requirements to meet revenues were up 14 percent But the rebound was less pronounced than at peers because of cuts Deutsche has made to the division Barclays on Thursday reported a 40 percent spike in its business In equities trading Deutsche saw revenue fall as low stock market volatility gave investors less reason to trade while revenue from corporate and investment banking fell by 1 percent 1  09173 euros This article was contributed by Reuters Please contact TRUNEWS correspondent Edward Szall with any news tips related to this story Email  Twitter
