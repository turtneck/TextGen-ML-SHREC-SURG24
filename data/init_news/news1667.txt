Cable news is in trouble The Pew Research Center reports that the median daily audience for Fox CNN and MSNBC is down about 11 percent since 2008The Washington Posts Paul Farhi seesa grim future for the industry He argues that cable news outlets are pretty much where newspapers were a decade ago their audience is aging their medium is being disrupted by new technologies and the next generation of viewers is developing habits and preferences that theyre poorly placed to serve This is probably a good moment to note that Im a contributor to MSNBCThe networks may still be making money  in 2014 Fox News managed 12 billion in profits while CNN cleared 300 million and MSNBC made a bit more than 200 million  but Farhi suggests the cable news networks will face bankruptcy the same way Ernest Hemingway once described a characters financial demise Gradually and then suddenlyPerhaps thats right But while Farhis account of cable news outlets woes focuses mainly on the cable part of the equation its also worth considering the problems all three networks are having with the news itselfThe rise of the three major cable news networks were all driven by stories they dominated CNN was made by the 1991 Gulf War It wasnt just the first time it passed the networks in ratings it was the first time CNN showed that it could beat the networks in coverage You can still feel the surprise in this New York Times article from 1991The shooting in the Persian Gulf began tonight with the three broadcast networks committed to covering the war on a 24hour basis although their image as news leaders was damaged by the Cable News Networks early dominance of the coverage  he networks image was certainly not helped when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he was following the attacks on Baghdad on CNN At least one network station an NBC station in Detroit decided to quit its networks coverage to run CNNs And NBC finally was compelled to interview CNN reporters on the air to get information out of BaghdadFox News for its part saw basically exponential growth around 911 and then again around the 2008 campaign and Obamas election MSNBCs rise was driven by the backlash to the Bush administration and particularly to the Iraq WarThe network held those gains in the first half of the Obama era as liberals went from terrified to triumphant But as liberals have gone from triumphant to a bit depressed and checked out viewership has begun to declineThe recent rise of cable news  particularly Fox and MSNBC  came in a period when the news  particularly political news  was unusually interestingBetween 2000 and 2012 we saw a contested US presidential election the largest terrorist attack ever on US soil wars in Afghanistan and Iraq repeated wave elections a global financial crisis the first black president the rise of the Tea Party the fight over Obamacare and the first states to legalize gay marriage and marijuana  and much more Its been a weirdly interesting consequential period in American politics And so the cable news networks which could devote 24 hours a day to covering these stories benefitedBut now its an unusually dull period in American politics Congress is gridlocked and is likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future The US thankfully isnt reeling from a terrorist attack or a financial crisis We havent invaded Iran at least not yet And its not just cable news thats losing viewers because of it Turnout in the 2014 election was the lowest its been in 70 yearsYou see this I think in the specific fortunes of the cable networks Farhi reports that MSNBC lost 14 percent of its audience in 2014 and Fox lost 2 percent But CNN prime time  which swung away from politics toward covering plane crashes and airing documentaries  is up 10 percent in 2015Which is all to say that Farhi may be right about the longterm decline of cable news  over some extended period of time both network and cable channels are going to be diminished by whatever it is the internet creates in their placeBut year to year a lot of the ups and downs might just be the appeal of whats actually in the news If President Scott Walker goes to war with Iran MSNBCs ratings are going to go up If President Hillary Clinton takes away everyones guns Fox is going to boom But for now relative peace and stability are bad news for cable news
