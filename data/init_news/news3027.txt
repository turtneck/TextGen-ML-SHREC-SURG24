Theyre not crossing the Rio Grande theyre invading Mexico from the south  No Mexico Doesnt Have A Wall On Its Southern BorderBut If Trump Wins It Might Build One  November 6 2016 1055 pm   Many people say Mexico has a wall on its southern border It doesnt  It should And if it did we Americans wouldnt have to deal with all the Central Americans coming to our own border It would be better for both our nations  Some outlets are reporting Mexico is going to build a wall against migrants  Mexico builds its own wall against migrants  by James Fredrick and Jude Webber Financial Times September 14 2016 The article is paywalled but you can access it here  But the title is misleading Its not a literal wall but a metaphorical wall and not even an effective one The piece takes the view of a Central American planning to come to the United States and claims Mexico already acts as a formidable barrier It also quotes a nun who runs a shelter for illegals in Mexico City  She moans Mexico has become a wall for migrants The current Mexican policy is to arrest migrants to stop them from getting to the US border Thus the term wall is a metaphor for some Central Americans get caught in Mexico and deported back to Central America Not very impressive The Mexican policy for dealing with its own illegals is a hodgepodge Though Mexico doesnt have walls on its borders with Guatemala and Belize Mexican authorities do detain and deport illegal aliens  And the American government has reportedly put pressure on Mexico to do more Nonetheless plenty are still getting through According to the article Mexico deported a record 175000 Central Americans last year but the United Nations estimates 400000 enter Mexico annually There is a preelection surge of illegals on the USMexican border as migrants want to get in now regardless of who wins If Hillary wins they expect amnesty If Trump wins they expect The Wall  Illegal immigrants surging to USMexico border in race against ElectionDay

Than Coming to US by Ana GonzalezBarrera Pew November 19 2015 But this misses the point Illegals coming across the southern border are coming from Mexico As Mexico cant or wont stop them we need a barrier on our border with Mexico Which brings us to another question If Trump wins the election and builds The Wall the Mexican government may be stuck with Central Americans who cant continue north to the US And they really dont want that In 2012 after the election of current Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto but before his inauguration his coordinator Arnulfo Valdivia discussed the new administrations goal in this area The new Mexican president wanted to create the necessary filters so that those who cross by the southern border of Mexico do not stay stranded in their attempt to cross to the United States Valdivia also said a goal was to diminish the number of indocumentados illegal aliens who are concentrated on the northern border of Mexico without possibilities of crossing it forming belts of poverty in Mexico Pea quiere patrulla fronteriza mexicana  by Miriam Castillo Milenio  October 9th 2012 In other words if they cross Mexico and get to the United States we dont care as long as they dont stay in Mexico And Mexico admits these illegals bring poverty Indeed Mexican authorities are quite cynical about this A new report indicates the Mexican government is granting Haitians 20day transit documents to reach the US border resulting in a 1800 in illegal Haitians c rossing the border in 2016 As Duncan Hunters chief of staff Joe Kasper said Mexico doesnt want them but its entirely content with putting migrantsin this case Haitiansright on Americas doorstep  DHS Documents Reveal How Mexico Is Helping Haitians Reach the US Illegally  Numbers USA October 11 2016 Remember this the next time somebody claims Mexico is our partner in securing the border But a President Trump who like the Israelis shuts down illegal immigration would force Mexico to build a border barrier if they dont want to be flooded by Central Americans This is no easy task given the geographical situation Mexicos border with Guatemala alone is 541 miles longabout a quarter the length of the USMexican border Its sparsely populated and crosses forested regions rivers lakes farmland pasture valleys and mountains some of which are in the 13000 feet above sea level range But where theres a will theres a way Some form of effective fencing could be done depending on the particular ecosystem by utilizing natural barriers such as mountains rivers and valleys as part of an overall border security plan And its already being suggested in the Mexican press A bold editorial in Maana  a newspaper from the Mexican border city of Reynosa openly calls for a border wall with Central America S al muro fronterizoPero en el sur de Mxico Yes to the Border WallBut in the South of Mexico July 24 2016 It argues Mexicos borders with Guatemala and Belize only give us problems because these crossings are utilized for a new invasion that of Central Americans who utilize our country to cross to the United States Thats very provocative language using the term invasion  invasin in Spanish The editorial also claims Central Americans are deported from the US back to Mexico even if theyre Central Americans and not Mexicans The greatest number are supposedly deported to Reynosa where they wait to try to enter America again But while they wait Many of these migrants not finding an honest way of earning a living dedicate themselves to crime resorting to assault kidnapping and extortion and in the worst of cases joining organized crime gangs This Mexican editorial says deported Central American illegals commit crimes in Mexico What intolerance It might as well have been written by Trump Indeed the editorial blames Central American illegals for much of the lawlessness of the border region Peace and tranquility have ended on the Mexican border and much of that has been due to the Central Americans who are deported from the US backed up with false documents who stay in Mexican territory The editorial proposes a solution Trumps idea of a wall is good  but more necessary than constructing a wall on the northern border of Mexico is to make one on the southsoutheast border to stop the passage of Central Americans to both countries Furthermore the Mexican government should also demand migratory documents for the foreigners who enter our country Though this editorial advocates a wall on Mexicos southern border not the American southern border theres no reason we cant do both And its unlikely the first will happen unless preceded by the second The editors of this paper have guts and are true Mexican patriots But in order to help Mexican patriots we need an American patriot in charge of our own country American citizen Allan Wall  him moved back to the USA in 2008 after many years residing in Mexico Allans wife is Mexican and their two sons are
