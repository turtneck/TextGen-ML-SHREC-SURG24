In her standard stump speech Hillary Rodham Clinton talks about fighting income inequality celebrating court rulings on gay marriage and health care and since the Emanuel AME Church massacre toughening the nations gun lawsThat last component marks an important evolution in presidential politics For at least the past several decades Democrats seeking national office have often been timid on the issue of guns for fear of alienating firearms owners In 2008 after Barack Obama took heat for his gaffe about people who cling to guns or religion he rarely mentioned guns again  neither that year nor in his 2012 reelection campaignBut in a sign that the political environment on guns has shifted in the wake of recent mass shootings  and of Clintons determination to stake out liberal ground in her primary race against insurgent Sen Bernie Sanders IVt  Clinton is not only initiating a debate about gun control but also vowing to fight the National Rifle AssociationIm going to speak out against the uncontrollable use of guns in our country because I believe we can do better Clinton said Tuesday in Iowa CityA few days earlier she said in Hanover NH We have to take on the gun lobby  This is a controversial issue I am well aware of that But I think it is the height of irresponsibility not to talk about itClintons comments could stoke millions of politically active gun owners and Wayne LaPierre the NRAs executive vice president argued that the move was fraught with peril for herWeve been down this road before with the Clintons LaPierre said through a spokesman She needs to read her husbands bookIn his memoir My Life former president Bill Clinton suggested that his vice president Al Gore lost the 2000 presidential election in part because of backlash in states such as Arkansas and Tennessee over the Clinton administrations 1995 ban on assault weapons which has since expired Many Democratic lawmakers also lost their elections after guncontrol votesThe Republican 2016 presidential candidates in keeping with GOP orthodoxy have spoken out loudly against gun control Many gave speeches at the NRAs spring convention and tout their high ratings from the groupMark Glaze a longtime guncontrol advocate who until recently oversaw former New York mayor Michael R Bloombergs guncontrol efforts argued that Hillary Clinton should embrace her husbands recordThe Clintons pulled off the almostimpossible by giving us the backgroundcheck system and banning assault weapons Glaze said Thats something President Obama wasnt able to do Their political interest lies in owning rather than obscuring that accomplishmentMany Democratic strategists said campaigning on guns is smart politics for Hillary Clinton both in the primary and should she become the nominee in the general electionGun control is one of the few issues on which Clinton has a more leftleaning record than Sanders who represents a rural progunrights state and has voted in the past for legislation to protect the firearms industry Although Clinton has not attacked Sanders by name by invoking guns she makes an unspoken contrastThe issue also fits neatly into the overall narrative Clinton is trying to present She can stake out a bold stance on an issue that plays well with the liberal base while arguing that she would break through the partisan stalemate in WashingtonThere are few issues more intractable than guns In 2013 after the massacre of 20 young children and six educators at an elementary school in Newtown Conn a bipartisan compromise to expand background checks for firearm purchases failed to pass the Senate despite overwhelming popular support and President Obamas backingClinton began talking about gun control in the days following last months church shooting in Charleston SC and aides said she plans to keep it in her stump speech although she has no immediate plans to unveil a detailed gun policyThis is an important issue and she believes that we cannot let partisan gridlock prevent us from continuing to seek commonsense safety measures said Clinton campaign spokesman Brian FallonDespite his mixed voting record Sanders did support the 2013 backgroundcheck bill and assaultweapons ban And on the stump he is trying to sound more forceful He notes that guns in Chicago and Los Angeles mean a very different thing than guns in Vermont and New Hampshire but says  as he did two weeks ago in Bow NH  that the next president must come forward with a commonsense proposal on gunsIn the Democratic field former Maryland governor Martin OMalley has the strongest record in favor of gun control He supported an assaultweapons ban as mayor of Baltimore in the early 2000s and then signed one into law as governor in 2013 along with a suite of gun restrictions that stand as among the nations toughestHes the only person in the race whos led on this issue said OMalley spokeswoman Haley MorrisLooking to the general election some guncontrol measures are popular especially with the coalition of swingstate Latinos African Americans and young and suburban women the Democratic nominee would need to win the White HouseThere is no more powerful force in an election than the suburban mother and you dont find a lot of suburban mothers that are against some sort of commonsense gun control said Mo Elleithee a former Clinton adviser and Democratic strategist who now directs the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public ServiceOther Democrats argue that Clinton has nothing to lose Sen Timothy M Kaine DVa said the NRA has become a paper tiger noting the elections hes won despite the NRAs vocal oppositionI think she has no illusion that even if she didnt say a word about guns the NRA would be out there blasting her to say she had a conspiratorial plan to work with the UN to take everybodys guns away so why not go headon on an issue that will improve safety Kaine saidA survey this year by the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research found that 89percent favor requiring background checks for all gun sales including 85percent of gun owners But polling is much more closely divided on other gun restrictions and does not account for the high intensity among guncontrol opponentsDavid Mudcat Saunders a Democratic strategist based in conservative rural Virginia warned that Clintons focus on guns could taint the entire Democratic ticket including candidates for state and local officesNever in the history of the Democratic Party have they started a gun debate that didnt cost them numbers in the general election said Saunders who supports the candidacy of former senator Jim Webb DVa Shes trying to get to the left of Bernie obviously but I think itll hurt her in the long run  and itll cost anybody on the down ticket in the South and in rural AmericaIn her 2008 presidential campaign Clinton stayed nearly silent on guns An exception was after Obamas cling to guns comment surfaced when she attacked him as being elitist and fondly recalled her father teaching her to shoot as a little girl at her grandfathers Pennsylvania lake houseHoward Wolfson for many years a top Clinton aide before going to work for Bloomberg said Clintons avoidance of guns in 2008 should not be mistaken for a lack of interest in gun controlI started working for her back in 1999 and she talked about it back then Wolfson said As a senator from New York it was something that was important to her I think in the wake of Newtown and Charleston its more resonant in our political cultureIn recent months Clintons speechwriters and policy staff have sought counsel from Bloombergs group Everytown for Gun Safety Erika Soto Lamb Everytowns spokeswoman said Clintons focus on the issue is strikingKnowing how hard we tried in 2012 to get Republican nominee Mitt Romney or Obama to say something about guns she said it is a changed world now when Hillary and other candidates are making it a part of their stump This is the first presidential election when weve seen proactive statementsJose DelReal in Iowa City and Scott Clement in Washington contributed to this report
