The escalating feud between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz has expanded into a fight for the backing of the GOPs antiestablishment establishment with both seeking validation from figures with immense influence on the rightTrump unfurled a highly anticipated endorsement from former Republican vicepresidential nominee Sarah Palin while campaigning in Iowa on Tuesday giving him a jolt among the partys restless base Palins endorsement came a day after Trump received the effusive praise of evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr whose views could help Trump among religious votersBut other conservative voices many of whom had cheered Trump in recent months have rallied to Cruzs side On talk radio Mark Levin and Glenn Beck have fumed over Trumps recent questions about Cruzs Canadian birth In Cruz they see a movement leader who champions their values whereas they say Trump is an interloper who lacks an ideological coreThe frenzied courting of conservatives is testament to their power in shaping a contest that is being dominated by two Washington outsiders Neither has won the backing of a single governor or senator  and its unclear that either man even wants to In this race it is the media titans personalities and activists who have long stood on the GOPs fringe who now have all the cachetYou need a scorecard to keep track said Craig Shirley a conservative historian Talk radio and bloggers  anyone outside of the system is at the center of the party and were witnessing in real time the shift away from the Republican establishment in deciding who the nominee will bePalin on Tuesday described Trump as someone who could change the status quo in American politics and she praised his values as a father and community leaderHe builds big things things that touch the sky she said as Trump looked on glowingly He has spent his life looking upOf the GOP leadership and critics of Trump she said They are so busted  What the heck would the establishment know about conservatismAfter Palin finished Trump waved and put his arm around her Were going to give them hell he said as the crowd roaredThe value of Palins endorsement was hotly debated Tuesday with Trump supporters saying her popularity in Iowa will give the realityTV star a significant lift and Cruz backers playing down her impactBarry Bennett Ben Carsons former campaign manager sided with those who thought it was consequential I think Sarah Palin actually helps Trump a lot because shes showing them that its okay Bennett said Whatever lack of credentials he has hes making some inroads into places where we didnt think hed playOne key Cruz ally said Palin could help Trump win over women Hes a thricemarried nonchurchgoing billionaire and she gives him credibility with conservative women said Kellyanne Conway who manages a Cruz super PAC Its a net positivePalins move came as a surprise to some in her orbit given her friendly rapport with both Trump and Cruz In 2011 she dined with Trump at a pizza shop in New York as she mulled her own White House bid and according to Republicans familiar with her thinking she has been increasingly enthusiastic about Trump as he has surged in the current race Their circles also overlap Trumps political director Michael Glassner is a former Palin aideAside from Palin Trumps campaign is backed by prominent conservatives such as activist Phyllis Schlafly and radio host Michael Savage Willie Robertson a star of the Duck Dynasty realityTV show is with Trump tooLast week it was Cruz who won the support of another Duck Dynasty star when Phil Robertson signed on The senator from Texas is also backed by longtime activists such as L Brent Bozell III and Richard Viguerie social conservative leader James Dobson and actor James WoodsIt is on talk radio especially where Cruz has built support which has proved critical now that Trump has taken to attacking him relentlessly Most of these drivetime and lunchhour heroes to rankandfile Republicans were initially complimentary of Trumps focus on illegal immigration last year but they have since souredIm sick and tired of stupid talk Levin said Monday on his program This is why Im sick and tired of stupid issues I didnt spend 40 years of my life  45 to be exact  to reach a point where we actually might take back the White House with somebody who is conservative whomever that is to be discussing birther issuesOn Saturday Beck will appear in Waterloo Iowa at a rally hosted by a proCruz super PAC Those who are planning to be with Beck onstage attest to Cruzs strength on the right in the state Rep Steve King conservative author David Barton and Christian organizer Bob Vander Plaats Cruz is banking on that deep goodwill carefully built up over the course of the 2013 government shutdown and the 2014 elections to sustain himTrump and Cruz had spent most of the campaign praising each other but they have switched to attack mode ahead of the Iowa caucuses on Feb 1Trumps case against Cruz is more temperamental than ideological He has called the Texan nasty and disliked by his Senate colleagues and has wondered aloud repeatedly whether Cruzs birth in Canada leaves him vulnerable to lawsuits over his citizenshipWhen you talk about temperament Ted has got a rough temperament Trump said Tuesday in Winterset Iowa ahead of the Palin event You cant call people liars on the Senate floor when they are your leaderCruz has a more understated approach He mostly avoids taking personal shots at Trump and keeps his emphasis on the policy differences between them pointing out where the businessman has sided with Democrats in particularIf youre looking for someone whos a dealmaker who will capitulate even more to the Democrats and give in to Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi then perhaps Donald Trump is your man Cruz told reporters Tuesday at a stop in Barnstead NHPalins endorsement which came after days of teasing by Trumps campaign and widespread speculation on cable TV riled the right in the hours before it was made officialAppearing Tuesday morning on CNN Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler called Palins expected nod a blow to her reputation because she would be endorsing someone whos held progressive views all their lifeI think if it was Sarah Palin  let me just say Id be deeply disappointed he saidSupporters of Palin and Trump responded with fury In a blog post Palins eldest daughter Bristol wrote that Tylers remark makes me hope my mom does endorse TrumpBy the afternoon after Sarah Palins endorsement Cruz felt compelled to clarify that Tylers view did not reflect his own I love Sarah Palin Sarah Palin is fantastic he told reporters I will always remain a big big fan of Sarah PalinsThe drama Tuesday was not limited to the right Fault lines were beginning to be drawn by members of the GOP leadership as they grappled with the possibility of having the race come down to Trump or Cruz rather than a candidate who is a more natural fit with donors and party brassSpeaking at an Iowa energy summit Gov Terry Branstad R called Cruz an opponent of renewable fuels who should be defeatedTrump reacted gleefully on Twitter Wow the highly respected Governor of Iowa just stated that Ted Cruz must be defeated Big shocker People do not like TedBranstads position reflects a broader unease with Cruz among Republican leaders In Trump most party leaders see a candidate who is unpredictable and controversial but far less ideological than Cruz and therefore more likely to work with them Several have reached out to Trump in recent weeks as their preferred candidates have stalled in the pollsCruz was dismissive of Branstad and said the development signals his own stature as the races only true conservative outsider It is no surprise that the establishment is in full panic mode Cruz told reporters TuesdayRush Limbaugh who has not picked a side in the TrumpCruz standoff said on his program Tuesday that Trump is trying to position Cruz as angry unstable cant get along with anybody and thus will not be able to do deals  Cruz is trying to highlight Trumps past liberalism New York values what have you
