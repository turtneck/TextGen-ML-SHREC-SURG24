When President Obama called for two years of free community college he also argued that nearly everyone should attend  that education should extend not to the 12th grade but to the 14th The goal he said is to make two years of college  as free and universal in America as high school is todaySome critics scolded Obama for emphasizing the importance of college over other paths The plan bows to elites wrote Megan McArdle Education is a very good thing but it is not the only good thing An indiscriminate focus on pushing more people into the system is no cure for societys illsBut supporters and opponents of the plan both missed something big Free community college wouldnt create an era of universal college enrollment because that era is already here So many high school graduates go on to college already that its unclear how much free tuition would boost attendance ratesThe real question is whether free community college can get kids through the door and signed up for their first highered class The big unknown is whether it can help more students graduateGoing to college in the United States is already a nearly universal experience By the time the high school class of 2004 turned 26 eight years after high school graduation 86 percent had enrolled in college according to an analysis of a nationally representative study from the William T Grant FoundationThats not quite universal  it doesnt count high school dropouts Still the 86 percent of students who go to college includes a sizable proportion of high school graduates who didnt initially think they would The Education Department said 67 percent of the class of 2004 enrolled in college right awayThe problem isnt college enrollment  its college completion Only about 59 percent of students who started college fulltime at a fouryear college in 2006 graduated by 2012For students who go to community college graduation rates are even lower Nearly half of students  43 percent  who started community college in fall 2008 dropped out according to the National Student Clearinghouse which tracks graduation statistics Another 18 percent were still enrolled six years later for a degree that should take two years Fewer than half had earned any kind of degree at allPoor preparation from K12 schools is certainly part of the problem But it wasnt the only factor In the high school class of 2004 44 percent of students with high test scores who started at a community college still didnt earn a certificate or degree within eight yearsObama knows the US has a college graduation problem In 2009 in a televised address to Congress soon after his inauguration he vowed to fix it By 2020 he said the US should be the besteducated country in the world At the time the US ranked 12th in the percentage of young adults with a college degreeAfter six years hundreds of millions of dollars spent by private foundations and new policies from states and colleges meant to encourage graduation the percentage of 25 to 34yearolds with a college degree has increased  but only by about 3 percentage points to 44 percent Other nations have continued to improve more quickly In South Korea twothirds of young adults have a college credentialHigh school graduation rates show that progress can be slow and incrementalIn 1940 when starting high school was virtually universal nationwide graduation rates were only around 50 percent It took more than 30 years until the late 1970s for high school graduation to become anything close to the norm  and graduation rates later fell only recently hitting an alltime high of 80 percentIf high school is the example a significant increase in college graduation rates could be decades not just years out on the horizon But other countries have increased their graduation rates more quickly  Norway Poland the Netherlands and the United Kingdom among themBut the nearuniversality of college attendance for high school graduates suggests getting still more students into college wont be enough Free tuition alone wont solve the problem Still there are two ways Obamas plan could helpFirst the college dropout problem centers almost entirely on students from families in the middle class and below In the wealthiest quartile of families students who enter college are virtually guaranteed to graduate For everyone else its at best a coin flipPart of the problem might be money Theres a familiar saying about students who drop out particularly at community colleges Life got in the way Students who struggle to work or to afford transportation or child care often get sidetracked on the way to a degree Not having to pay tuition would free up students to use grants or loans for living expenses Still the maximum Pell Grant for lowincome students isnt enough to live on for a full academic year so its not clear whether cheaper tuition would be enough to make a differenceSecond the proposed community college plan is structured as a grant for states with strings attached to encourage reforms In order to get the federal money meant to cover 75 percent of students tuition states would have to agree to evidencebased institutional reforms  strategies like the ASAP program at the City University of New York an intense support system for community college students that has pushed threeyear graduation rates for participants to over 50 percentThose programs have shown promise and states and community college districts could adopt them even if Congress doesnt pass Obamas plan and it probably wont But theyre also expensive One lesson of the past few years changing completion rates will take both time and money
