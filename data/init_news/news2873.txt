Cincinnati CNN While Republicans rally in Cleveland this week Hillary Clintons presidential campaign with help of the Democratic National Committee will set up shop in the Rock and Roll Capital of the World to cast the Republican ticket as outoftouch with what voters actually wantBut the Clinton campaign also plans to spend a substantial amount of time on defense this week especially around Clintons exclusive use of a private email server as secretary of stateIn a fact sheet written and distributed by Brian Fallon Clintons national press secretary the Clinton campaign argues that while Donald Trump will focus on Clintons emails and FBI Director James Comeys investigation and comments about the issue most of what the presumptive Republican nominee will say will be falseWith the Republican National Convention set to take place next week Trump is likely to continue distorting Comeys words about Clintons emails Fallon wrote adding that while some comments Comey made did provide initial fodder for Trump his testimony on Capitol Hill earlier this month on the topic ended up substantiating what Clinton has long saidThe prepared as defense is not just a nod to the fact that Clintons email controversy continues to nag her but its also an acknowledgement to the fact that the one thing that may unite all Republicans in Cleveland this week is disdain for the idea of a Clinton presidencyDozens of Clinton aides from a headquarters less than a mile from the Quicken Loans Arena will also push their counterconvention plan  titled Better Than This  this week trying to amplify the idea that America is better than the divisive and dangerous rhetoric Donald Trump has offered us said Christina Reynolds Clintons rapid response directorClintons top dollar super PAC Priorities USA will also blanket the city in antiTrump advertising making sure anyone who gets into a cab in Cleveland gets the question Does Donald Trump really speak for youThe super PAC has paid for their ad to play in 125 cabs in Cleveland for the entirety of the Republican convention The spot which features women and fathers with the daughters wearing Trump shirts and reading some of his more controversial lines about women will be played an estimated 28000 times said the groups spokesman Justin BaraskyClinton herself will not be in Cleveland but unlike past year when opposing candidates would stay dark most of the week the former secretary of state has stops scheduled in Ohio Minnesota and NevadaOn Monday when Republicans plan to focus on the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi at their convention Clinton will announce a plan to register 3 million new voters by Election Day in November when she speaks at the 107th NAACP Annual Convention in Cincinnati an aide said SundayAfter the speech Clinton will attend a Cincinnati voter registration rally for volunteers who have completed at least one shift for Clintons campaignThe aide added that voter registration will be a primary campaign focus during the week of the RNC with the campaign and other Democratic groups hosting more than 500 registration events across the country Multiple events will take place in swing states like Ohio Pennsylvania Michigan and WisconsinClinton will also travel to Minneapolis on Monday to attend the American Federation of Teachers Convention and headline a fundraiserClinton will then travel to Nevada on Tuesday where she will speak at the 42nd International AFSCME Convention and headline another fundraiserWith much of the political world focused on the Republicans in Cleveland it is expected that Clinton will respond to Republicans at these eventsEarlier this month in Virginia Clinton knocked the Republican convention as a great event If you are into bigotry bluster and bullyingWe are going to have a great convention in Philadelphia Clinton said I have no idea what is going to happen in ClevelandShe added It is going to be entertaining I am sure if you are into bigotry bluster and bullying if you are into drawing lines between Americans if you are into insulting groups of Americans if you are into saying you dont want to let Muslims into the country you want to round up and deport 11 million people with a quote deportation force if you enjoy seeing women demeanedThe Democrats will have an uphill battle to get attention though Conventions are a boon for the hosting party in part because of the blanket coverage they get by the press Trump will likely lead cable and broadcast news every night so the goal Democrats have is to muddy his message and break in at allClintons aides in Cleveland will try to break through the medias focus on the Republicans with a series of press conference press calls and eventsWe believe the Republican convention will be a great recruiting tool  reminding voters how important it is to help Hillary Clinton make history and ensure that Donald Trump never takes the White House Reynolds saidAccording to Reynolds Democratic events in Cleveland will includes appearances by Sen Al Franken Rep Tim Ryan and Rep Xavier Becerra all Democrats who have been talked about as possible vice presidential options for the former secretary of stateDemocratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz will also headline events along with Rep Marcia Fudge Rep Joyce Beatty Ohio Senate candidate Ted
