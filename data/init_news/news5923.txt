Is something wrong with Hillary ClintonIn an unprecedented move and with just 6 electoral votes to go for a Donald Trump Presidency Hillary Clinton refused to address the country and sent her aid John Podesta to address supporters at Javits CenterWe can wait a little longer cant we Theyre still counting votes and every vote should count Several states are too close to call so were not going to have anything more to say tonight Watch At Youtube While the New York Times is now projecting a Donald Trump victory with 95 certainty Clinton will not concedeA candidate would normally address the crowd if there was a question as to the validity of results Or in what is quite possible the most important Presidential election in American history the candidate could at least stay up until the votes are countedThis begs the question Did Hillary have another medical episodePerhaps Hillary isnt ready for that 3AM phone call after all
