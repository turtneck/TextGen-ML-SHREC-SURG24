An old saying asserts that falsehoods come in three escalating levels Lies damn lies and statistics Now however weve been given an evenhigher level of intentional deception Policy speeches by Donald Trump Take his recent highly publicized address outlining specific economic policies he would push to benefit hardhit working families Its an almosthilarious compilation of Trumpian fabrications including his bold statesmanlike discourse on the rank unfairness of the estate tax No family will have to pay the death tax he solemnly pledged adopting the rightwing pejorative for a tax assessed on certain properties of the dearly departed Fine but next came his slick prevarication American workers have paid taxes their whole lives and they should not be taxed again at death Workers The tax exempts the first 54 million of any deceased persons estate meaning 998 percent of Americans pay absolutely nothing So Trump is trying to deceive real workers into thinking hes standing for them when in fact its his own wealth hes protectingWhat a maverick What a shakeemup outsider What an antiestablishment fighter for working stiffsOh and dont forget this What a phonySure The Donald sounds like a populist on the stump bellowing that the systems been jerryrigged by and for the corporate and political elites which is killing the middle class Well hes right about that but whats he going to do Dont worry he says smugly Ill fix it Ill make the system honest again  trust meAs Groucho Marx said To know if a man is honest ask him  if he says he is hes a crook Or in the case of this phony populist just look at the specific policies he laid out as his fixes for our economy Trumpeting the package as his blueprint for the economic renewal of Americas working classBut Trumps idea of working class turns out to be millionaires and billionaires for thats who would get the bulk of benefits from his agenda  rewarding the very corporate chieftains he denounces in his blustery speeches for knocking down middleincome families and grabbing all of the new wealth our economy is creating His proposed tax cuts for example dont benefit lowwage workers at all and provide only a pittance of gain for those with middleclass paychecks but corporations are given a huuuuuuuge windfall with over a 50 percent cut in their rate His tax giveaway will also take 240 billion a year out of our public treasury  money desperately needed for such basics as expanding educational opportunities and restoring our nations dilapidated infrastructureIn his policy speech he offered a new tax break to help hard working people reduce their cost of child care by allowing parents to fully deduct such spending from their taxes Trump even gave this push a personal touch saying his daughter Ivanka urged him to provide a helping hand to working parents because she feels so strongly about this Before you tear up over their show of dad and daughter workingclass empathy however note that 70 percent of American households dont make enough to warrant itemizing tax deductions Thus the big majority of Americans that are most in need of child care help get nothing from Trumps melodramatic gesture Once again his generosity is for his own elite class for the tax benefits would flow uphill to wealthy families like his who can purchase the platinum packages of care for their children What we have here is the same old failed establishmentarian economic elitist hokum that Republicans have been peddling for decades only bigger and more extreme Rhetoric aside the reality of Trumps plan is to replace Ronald Reagans trickledown theory with his own arrogant antiworker scheme of tinkledown economics As an early 19th Century labor leader noted Figures dont lie but liars do figure That fits The Donald perfectly
