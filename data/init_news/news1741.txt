Each week In Theorytakes on a big idea in the news and explores it from a range of perspectives This week were talking about polarization in politics Need a primer Catch up hereDavid Broockman is an assistant professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of BusinessAcademic handwringing rarely changes political institutions But political science researchers recent obsession with political polarization seems to be having some impact These researchers argue that polarization has put the nation at risk and are championing reforms meant to stem itThe remedies proposed are many  from reforming campaign finance to changing the primary system  and all share a common theme By shifting more political power to everyday people academics believe that extreme politicians would be encouraged to heed the publics centrist demandsThe widespread view that citizens are more centrist than politicians seems obvious but its actually misleading at best And worse its endangering our democracyVoters Are Not All CentristsMost voters support some liberal policies and some conservative policies Academics have long taken this as evidence of voters underlying centrismBut just because voters are ideologically mixed does not mean they are centrists at heart Many voters support a mix of extreme liberal policies like taxing the rich at 90 percent and extreme conservative policies like deporting all undocumented immigrants These voters only appear centrist on the whole by averaging their extreme views together into a single point on a liberalconservative spectrumThis makes those who celebrate voter centrism rather like the fabled statistician who drowned in a river that was 2 feet deep on average Even if voters are centrist on average they can be quite extreme on many particular issuesThe result Reforms that empower voters may not push politicians further to the center  instead they may encourage politicians to pander to extreme views popular among voters Indeed where they have been enacted many changes that reformers favor  like public funding of elections and toptwo primaries  have resulted in politicians doing just this By seeking to further empower voters in the name of reducing polarization wellmeaning reformers may actually be encouraging dangerous extremismPolitical scientists and pundits alike argue that it would improve governance to devolve political power from the political elites who know the most about politics and policy to the voters who know the least Polarization scholars hold these uninformed voters in the highest esteem because they look the most centrist on a leftright spectrum They are also Donald Trumps baseYes you read that right Political scientists have long exalted the centrist wisdom of those who now constitute some of Trumps strongest supporters  the poorly educated authoritarian xenophobes who are attracted to a platform suffused with white supremacy indulge in unapologetic nationalismand use violence to silence opponents As commentator Jacob Weisberg has written these extreme voters views are a mix of wacko left and wacko right  the key credential one needs to qualify as centrist by scholars most popular definitionTrumps popularity among these voters should have been no surprise Their penchant for extremism on many issues has been visible in public polling for years Indeed it has been visible for decades Modern public opinion research itself was founded scholars who had just witnessed World War II and had good reason to be fearful of mass publics extremist tendenciesYet despite our own countrys populist past many scholars today resist acknowledging public extremism is even possible Reviewers of my research for example dismissed as simply too doubtful the idea that voters might have some views more extreme than those of elected officials A simple conceptual error has blinded them to the true character of the Trump coalitionDismissing the publics susceptibility to extremism is not only naive  it is dangerous With antimajoritarian institutions like sixyear terms for senators the Founding Fathers empowered elites to serve as a check on unwise popular passionsReformers may find the Founding Fathers ideas outmoded After all if the public is a homogenous centrist mass why be afraid of unchecked popular controlTrumps rise brings the founders wisdom into sharp focus However reformers have by now already eliminated nearly every institutional safeguard that would once have stood in Trumps way to the Oval Office In previous eras party elites would be able to more easily foil his nomination at the Republican convention financial contributions to his competitors would be less limited and state legislators could have refused to pledge their states electoral votes to him As with insurance plans canceled right before a catastrophe the upside of these safeguards is only fully apparent when a demagogue like Trump is already doing damageThis is not to say that elites always have innocent or correct intentions Outright oligarchy is no better than outright direct democracy and conservative elites may even have inadvertently abetted Trumps rise The point is that the Founding Fathers were right to allow elites and voters to serve as checks and balances on each other Todays reformers have altogether forgotten the merits of one side of this equationOne reason scholars play down the benefits of allowing elites to serve the function the Founding Fathers envisioned is that they characterize todays political elites as highly extreme The empirical evidence for this view is also much flimsier than many realize Todays politicians strategically exaggerate their disagreements but on many issues these disagreements are substantively small by historical standards Indeedwhere yawning disagreements existed 50 years ago around issues of trade regulation race taxation redistribution and foreign policy there is now a Washington consensuson such matters to which both parties largely subscribeTodays elites certainly take some extreme positions But the prospect of President Trump does put the allegedly wholesale extremism of todays elites in perspective Trump seeks to shatter countless tenets of the Washington consensus in the name of shameless nationalism and overt xenophobia If he gets his way the United States would be plunged into a deep recession and millions of lives would be thrown into disarray That is real extremismStudents of polarization and pundits alike bemoan a disconnect between extreme elites and centrist voters arguing that voters must urgently be empowered to resolve it But what if voters would actually like to see todays politicians become more extreme on many issues What if many voters actually do at the end of the day agree with Trump In that case reforms that empower voters may have less appealing effects than supporters argueAdvocates of reforms would be wise to consider this possibility as they upend centuriesold
