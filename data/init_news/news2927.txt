Hillary Clinton was seen to help stabilize her faltering campaign Tuesday night with a debate performance that left little doubt she has a solid grip on the Democratic presidential race  and may have sent a strong message to Joe Biden that time is running out if he envisions jumping inThe Democratic frontrunner and her closest competitor Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders dominated the debate stage in Las Vegas relegating the other lowpolling candidates to footnote status But with the most to lose Tuesday night the Clinton camp seemed to come out of the debate revitalized with aides calling it the best day of their campaignI think things have stabilized Clinton pollster Joel Benenson saidThat claim will be put to the test in the coming weeks The vice president continues to mull a 2016 bid and the debate had been viewed by analysts as a significant factor in that ultimate decisionBiden watched the debate Tuesday night from afar at the Naval Observatory residence  and time will tell whether he thinks theres still room for him On WednesdayBiden said only that all the candidates did a good job and hes proud of all of themIn comparison with the Donald Trumpdominated GOP debates the leadoff showdown in Las Vegas Tuesday night was a relatively cordial affair for the Democrats with the lively disputes centering on policy differences and not personal putdowns But Clinton was the clear lightning rod challenged early and often on her shifting positions  while also hitting back and trying to position herself as a practical progressive with every bit as much credibility with the base as candidates like Sen Bernie SandersIm not taking a backseat to anybody on my values my principles and the results that I get Clinton said describing herself as a progressive who likes to get things doneThe frontrunner who has faced an insurgent challenge from her left in Sanders campaign was visibly ready to tangle Tuesday with him and the three other candidates on stage at the CNNFacebook debateWhile Sanders railed against a casino capitalist process Clinton warned against abandoning the system that built Americas middle class And Clinton sparred with Sanders and others as they questioned her call for a nofly zone in Syria and criticized her 2002 support as a senator for use of force in Iraq a decision shes since called a mistakeFormer Rhode Island Sen Lincoln Chafee called it a poor decision and said he did his homework when he opposed that measureClinton in her defense noted that President Obama asked her to be secretary of state because he valued my judgmentWhen former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley suggested lawmakers were overtaken by war fever Clinton quipped I am in the middle here  lots of things coming from all directions She then tweaked OMalley by thanking him for endorsing her in 2008While Clinton and Sanders sparred at times the Vermont senator mostly avoided aggressively attacking Clinton on stageWhen Clinton was pressed on her personal email scandal Sanders even jumped to her defenseIn one of the more memorable moments of the night Sanders said I think the secretary is right  The American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emailsClinton said Me too She thanked him and shook his handChafee though added that credibility is an issueThe exchange came after Clinton responded to a question on the email scandal by saying shes taken responsibility for it and acknowledged it was a mistakeShe quickly pivoted to challenging the work of the congressional Benghazi committee calling it basically an arm of the Republican National CommitteeThe former secretary of state was also challenged on her policy flips by moderator Anderson Cooper who asked if she will say anything to get electedIve been very consistent over the course of my entire life Clinton responded But she said like most human beings she has absorbed new informationClinton was specifically challenged for opposing the Pacificnation trade deal she once supported as secretary of state Though she once called it the gold standard she said Tuesday the deal didnt meet my standard She said she couldnt tell voters it would raise their wagesClinton though tried to turn the tables on her rivals and took a crack at Sanders record on gun controlAsked if the Vermont senator is tough enough on gun violence Clinton said No not at all and urged the country to stand up against the NRAShe criticized him for voting for a 2005 bill giving gun manufacturers immunity from lawsuits After Sanders described that bill as complicated she said It wasnt that complicated to meSanders responded All the shouting in the world is not going to end the violence He said the country needs to reach a consensus and stressed that rural states view gun laws differently than other statesThroughout the debate former Virginia Sen Jim Webb the fifth candidate on stage struggled to elbow his way into the conversation He stressed his military experience and push for criminal justice reform and other issues while in the SenateToward the end of the debate Webb challenged Sanders for his bigspending proposalsBernie I dont think the revolutions gonna come he said adding he doesnt think Congress would pay for a lot of his plansWebb Chafee and OMalley are all averaging at or below 1 percent in the polls nationally according to RealClearPolitics
