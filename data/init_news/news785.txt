Even the longterm unemployed are starting to find work But how strong is the jobs recovery reallyTrevor Parkes has been through the tunnel called unemployment in postrecession America and come out the other side In the summer of 2013 he moved from Texas to Tennessee so his family could be closer to his wifes parents But when his new job evaporated with a layoff after just four months Mr Parkes was in trouble unemployed in a difficult job market edging toward age 50 and with two kids moving through schoolNot least among his challenges He was still a newcomer to the Nashville area with few friends or connections to turn to for support I was basically terrified because I didnt know anyone here he saysEven with his wife working in youth ministry the year that followed was one of emotional turmoil Parkes tried it all Temp work Networking with other parents at his kids school Contacting former employers Mining online job boards Each week more rsums went out into the voidThen this past fall something changed First came a small regional bank that actually wanted to interview him Not long after came a call from the very bank that had laid him off It was starting a new flood insurance underwriting division and hired Parkes to be part of the teamThe job means new confidence and financial security for Parkes and his family It also represents a larger story of employment revival in the US economyTodays US job market is healthier than you might realize True the recovery is incomplete Even a good job market today wont mean conditions are easy for US workersYet the progress is real And crucially its helping to address one of the defining features of the Great Recession and its aftermath the large number of people who are longterm unemployed and in many cases at risk of dropping out of the workforce altogetherAn improved job climate has more broadly revived economic spirits across America For the first time since the Great Recession officially ended some 512 years ago Gallup and CNN polls find a majority of Americans having a positive view of the economyLast year saw the strongest US employment growth since 1999 and the official US unemployment rate has fallen to 57 percent of the labor force as of January down from 66 percent a year beforeIts certainly good news that payroll growth has eliminated a lot of the employment gap that resulted from the recession says Andrew Levin who is joining the economics faculty of Dartmouth College But at the current pace of job creation another 18 months to two years will probably be needed to reach full employmentIn fact even as the undeniable gains give the United States lower joblessness than many European nations the set of remaining challenges is also clear Middleclass incomes had been stagnating and inequality widening even before the recession Those trends have now become central political questions gaining attention from Republican and Democratic leaders alike in the runup to a presidential election in 2016 From robots to smart phones technology has opened new opportunities for consumers but is also disrupting traditional occupations Economist Tyler Cowen distilled the worry in a 2013 book Average Is Over forecasting a future in which an educated elite pulls increasingly far ahead of everyone else As the US emerges from the most protracted jobs bust since the Great Depression a historically high number of workingage civilians are still without work or underemployed Some have parttime jobs rather than the fulltime ones they hope for Some have grown so discouraged that theyve stopped even looking for workOne key worry is that many of the recessionsidelined Americans have become so detached from the workforce  losing skills connections marketability  that they may never work againReviving the rate of labor force participation the share of US adults who are working or wanting to work may be a vital measure of whether America is really nearing full employment Thats why at this point a month in which the unemployment rate edges up isnt necessarily a bad thing  if its a sign of more people being drawn into the job huntEconomist Stephen Rose of George Washington University sees the challenges but he also cautions against buying into a view of longterm pessimism Time and again he says forecasts of a grim future have emerged in times of economic distress technological change or global competition  and then been proved wrongAlready in at least a few industries a shortage of workers is starting to surface Tim Bowe chief executive of a productdevelopment firm based near Boston says the college and graduatedegree scientists hes looking to hire are hard to findThe market is not even tightening he says Its tightThe company called Foliage hopes to grow its 600person US workforce by 20 percent this year as it brings technology solutions to clients in industries from cars to industrial equipmentEven beyond strong fields like math and sciences employers have been adding jobs lately across a broad range of industries The new positions include many lowpaid ones in restaurants and retail shops But many are also in professional services sales and skilled factory work Fully 1 in 10 new jobs over the past year has come in construction a welcome revival for an industry that was hit especially hard by the recessionThe job gains have actually been coming since the end of 2010  and slower than anyone wished But last year saw a pickup in the pace a shift toward the better in public opinion about the economy and forecasts of continued job creation in 2015Even states such as Michigan and Ohio have seen high unemployment rates plummet in part because of a revival of automotive and other manufacturing And in 28 states led by many west of the Mississippi employment is now back above 2007 levelsThis is welcome news for workers of all agesYoung people between 16 and 24 years old actually have been the age group whose connections to work have most frayed since 2008 Their rate of participation in the labor force took a drop after the recession that was twice as big as the drop for workers ages 25 to 34 or ages 45 to 54Now that is changing Rashid Nelson a senior at Boston University says hes seen the job outlook improving steadily each year hes been in college And now he knows he has a job waiting as an account manager for ATT selling telecommunication technologies to both small and large businessesI just wanted to put myself in a good position he says of his intensive job hunt last fall I didnt want to be that one student who graduated and didnt know what he was doingThat focus not just an improved job market contributed to his finding a position He majored in an area thats in demand marketing planned carefully leaving his Fridays clear of classes for potential travel for job interviews and kept sending out applications during fall semesterToday as a student ambassador for Boston Universitys Center for Career Development hes urging peers to do similar planningOlder workers too are glad to see an improving employment climate Sam Jarman of San Diego went through a long stint of unemployment  twice Working in the mortgage industry an epicenter of the financial crisis he lost one job in 2008 He found another in 2009 making loan modifications for people at risk of foreclosureIt was a highlevel job managing other managers on the team but his job security was inversely related to the health of the economy By early last year he was laid off againThe business of making regular home loans was picking up but he was 51 years old and says no one would hire him They said Youve been out of the origination side for five years and a lot has changed We want to hire someone who has more recent experience Call it wisdom or desperation Mr Jarman began widening his efforts I prayed I networked I was ready to take anything I looked in health care at Petco Jack in the Box he says For the first time in 27 years I considered leaving California because there were no jobs hereBut in October he landed one in the lending industry and at a local credit union He took a 25 percent pay cut and is one step down from his prior managerial level but hes glad to be there I like it There are good people here and the company isnt going to leave San Diego he says I feel more secureAs of January the Bureau of Labor Statistics still counts 28 million Americans as unemployed for more than half a year and still looking for work Even when people do move forward its not unusual for the process to be startandstop  with new jobs that dont last very longThe positive thing is simply this From bluecollar workers to people like Jarman more and more jobless workers are finding their way back to workOne day last fall Lidia Sotomayor was doing a dress rehearsal for that pivotal few minutes that could make or break her future  a job interviewHer mock interviewer a woman from a group called Platform to Employment was in effect the drill sergeant in a boot camp for the longterm unemployed They coddled you for the first hour Ms Sotomayor recalls of the fiveweek intensive programSotomayor fought through the tough questions drawing on her training Dont be intimidated Pause to think but not for too long In the end the room of about two dozen other jobless people erupted in applause at her performanceThe rehearsal and the confidence boost soon bore fruit She now has a job as a bookkeeper in a small company based in her home city of Bridgeport Conn that makes electric cable assemblies for business clientsHer story offers a window on how todays job market though reviving remains tougher than before the recession  and is being transformed by evolving technologySotomayor was coached on how to craft a profile on the website LinkedIn and how that would help She learned how companies are besieged by electronic job applications  and quickly weed through them in ways that winnow out lots of viable candidatesJoseph Carbone who heads the organization that created Platform to Employment says the challenges for workers are long term as well as partly cyclicalThe days of getting a job and staying there for the rest of your working life and not blending in any additional education or training  theyre gone theyre over he says Managing ones career means youve got to be vigilantAs Mr Carbone describes it employers are simply warier of making a fulltime hire than they used to be If they can meet a workplace need with parttimers temp workers or contractors that takes financial and regulatory liabilities off their shoulders When they do hire fulltimers it comes with the expectation of continuous advancement in skillsThese arent new trends Lifelong learning was becoming more than just a catchphrase even in the 1990s But workplace change has accelerated Switching jobs is fine but being unemployed can quickly make ones skills look out of date  not to mention being a financial drainSotomayor says the training program hammered home a simple message Stop the bleed by getting reemployed even at a lower salary If a new job isnt within reach Carbone urges people to do something to show theyre active  taking courses or volunteering for instance Such lessons apply to young and old alikeMr Nelson the soontobe college grad is already steeped in the notion that he should keep his eye more than a few steps down the career trail He has a longterm goal to build experience toward working as a sports marketing agent in professional basketballAs more Americans who want jobs find
