by Lambert Strether By Lambert Strether of Corrente  The FTs Izabella Kaminska  The autoignition temperature of manual cars is much higher than Fahrenheit 451  brings McKinseys report on selfdriving cars to our attention An Integrated Perspective on the Future of Mobility PDF  Bloomberg writing on the report  put the key factlike price comparison in the deck Autonomous taxis onequarter the price of New York cab ride And then quoted the following eyepopping factlike dollarsandcents figure The selfdriving vehicles being pioneered by Tesla Motors Inc Alphabet Incs Google and others are poised to dramatically lower the cost of taxis potentially making them cheaper than buses or subways according to a joint report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance and McKinsey  Co Having no driver to pay could reduce taxi prices to 67 cents a mile by 2025  less than a quarter of the cost in Manhattan today the report found The word could seems to be doing rather a lot of work in the second sentence But how were those figures found On what basis did McKinsey the the trusted advisor and counselor to many of the worlds most influential businesses and institutions  come to its conclusions And here readers I went wrong I thought I would try to understand the business ratios and income statements of todays taxi industry  NAICS code 4853  income statement from Yellow Cab of Missoula MT 1 and use those as a baseline to evaluate McKinseys analysis That was a timeconsuming mistake and here is why Lets look at the report starting by having searched the PDF on 67 Here is the source for Bloombergs quote Exhibit 10 Ive helpfully highlighted the 67 interestingly a PDF search reveals that this is the only place where 67 appears There is for example no table or equation showing the calculations through which McKinsey arrived at that figure2 Nevertheless we look for some explanation and the best I can find is in the text adjacent to Exhibit 10 on pages 23 and 25 Ive pasted a snippet from page 23 in at the top of page 25 and helpfully highlighted some of the text and footnote 17 Now the 067 figure in Exhibit 10 applies only to the case of an individual use selfdriving taxi the chart says selfdriven but the caption is correct That is Jane Coder calls up a selfdriving taxi to get to work and when shes done with her commute the freedup taxi responds to a call from Joe Coder to go home and so on The taxi is not shared This use case is described in the paragraph marked 1 Here is that paragraph For many drivers ridehailing would nonetheless become the economic alternative An ondemand selfdriving vehicle could also replace most current sharedmobility business models such as car sharing carpooling and ridehailing it could drive itself to the next customer to a designated parking space or back to the point of origin Do you see any calculations there  indeed any numbers at all  that would justify the 067 figure No Notice also that could and would are working hard in this paragraph too We move on to the paragraph marked 2 If a private consumer were open to sharing a ride with another traveler the economics become even more attractive on average using a selfdriving electric pooled taxi could be 3060 percent cheaper per mile than a private vehicle depending on the number of people sharing the ride By 2025 a private car would cost 043mile whereas a consumer could use a selfdriving pooled taxi for as little as 017mile029mile 17  Here at least we see claims with numbers in them but none of them are relevant to the individual use selfdriving taxi case and so the 067 figure remains a mystery as yet unexplained We move on to the paragraph marked 3 Compared with public transport it appears that in various US cities public transport remains about as twice as cheap as humandriven taxi pooling with a cost of 064mile in 2015 The same applies the 067 figure remains inexplicable But wait Theres that footnote 17 in the paragraph marked 2 Costs are estimated the total cost of ownership assuming 70000 miles driven annually3 average driver salaries 10 percent overhead costs and a 10 percent required rate of return on invested capital for the fleet operator We assume a utilization factor of 50 percent for taxis and 70 percent for pooled cars This does not take into account a price premium for any additional journey time required to pick up multiple passengers Ive helpfully underlined the weasel words along with words that make me ask How do you know that Do you see a source for any of this No Why would that be Contrast footnote 17 in the left column to footnotes 18 19 and 20 in the right column all of which provide sources Wishing to give McKinsey the benefit of the doubt I looked for their editorial policies which I found on page 64 on the About page In relevant part So this really is the best part isnt it The information contained in this publication is derived from carefully selected sources we believe are reasonable Well I should hope so Trusted advisor and counsellor et cetera et cetera So thats alright then Although one could wish that the reasonable and carefully selected sources were named4    So Ive managed to emulate the classic bad New Yorker article I followed the ornithologists into the swamp because when they said they heard the call of a rare bird I believed them But they didnt find the bird So we still dont know where McKinsey got its sixtyseven cents 067 a mile figure for its selfdriving taxi use case What the Bloomberg reporter thought they were doing when they repeated it is another question And we dont know know why its report didnt provide an explanation for it Explanations that occur to me 1 An editorial disaster  Nobody checked footnote 17 to add the sourcing the for sixtyseven cents 067 a mile figure This strikes me as unlikely given the level of attention given to the reports design 2 A public relations scam  McKinsey simply made up the sixtyseven cents 067 a mile figure out of whole cloth This strikes me as unlikely given the whole trusted advisor schtick 3 A bait and switch  The source of the calculations for sixtyseven cents 067 a mile figure is internal and proprietary and McKinsey wont reveal anything until you engage them This strikes me as unlikely dittoez Tis a puzzlement NOTES 1 I dont want to whinge about this but when I was a sprat twenty years ago and I wanted industry ratios and company reports Id go down to the Boston Public Librarys Business Branch  display my library card and get the information for free  Google was awfully good at displaying results from industry research firms that demand a fee  but not so good with er free stuff Am I looking for stats in all the wrong places 2 Why 67 Why not 65 Or 70 Id hate to think McKinsey guilty of spurious precision 3 New Yorks Taxicab Factbook estimates that the average cab travels 70000 miles per year 4 Theres also We do not guarantee its accuracy or completeness and nothing in this document shall be construed to be a representation of such a guarantee but I assume Bud from Legal insisted that go in and I dont hold it against them APPENDIX I like this too From page 49 And the text Within the mobility sector itself an ondemand selfdriving taxi could replace most current sharedmobility business models Adding a selfdriving component to carsharing operations ridehailing services and taxi services makes the business models indistinguishable Indeed it could Exactly in the way the wizards of Unseen University nailing magic broomsticks under Sam Vimess horsedrawn coach made it indistinguishable from an airborne supersonic vehicle 0 0 0 0 0 0
