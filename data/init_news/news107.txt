Report Copyright Violation nuclear weapons question Hello all I have been a longtime lurker on this board but this is my first time posting I have many questions that Im hoping someone can help me with since you all seem to be very knowledgeable in this areaIn terms of nuclear weapons I know we have tested over 1000 and I know the radiation has increased cases of cancer and killed livestock but shouldnt there be more of an impact I know the theory with nuclear war ending life as we know it derives from the fact that it would cause a nuclear winter there for beginning some sort of ice age on earth with all the weapons that have been tested should we not have already brought ourselves to this or does it more have to do with all weapons going off all at once Another question being I heard that radiation dissipates quickly with the most dangerous time being the first 48 hours if so then how would it cause a nuclear winter I know these are silly questions I am pretty bad with science so I am hoping someone can explain betterAnother question I am very sure this article has been linked here before but wondering if someone can give me their thoughts and either disprove the article or explain why its true  link to heiwacotripodcom  Personally I find its safer to believe they work if a crazy person threatens you saying they have a gun you take it for face value You dont want to question them about it or dare them to prove itIn terms of world 3 have all biblical prophecies been fulfilled already to believe world war 3 is next on the timeline I would be lying if I said Im not scared When it comes to death it sucks sure but Im not afraid for myself Im afraid for my one year old I will do ANYTHING to protect her even if it means giving up my life so she can have a beautiful healthy long life I do believe in God and I find myself turning a lot to him these last few days but I cant help but be angry and feel so guilty bringing this beautiful soul into this world for what So she can suffer and die before she even turns 3 I just feel so lost and hurt If anyone can give me advice or guidance I would appreciate it more than you know The aspect of the end being at our door isnt too much a problem for me its more the aspect that I dont want this for my child I want her to live her life Fall in love See the worldI dont know maybe the time isnt here weve been close to a nuclear war once before maybe just maybe we can dodge this again Page 1
