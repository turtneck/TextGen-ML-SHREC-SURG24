This is what a fullfledged feeding frenzy looks likeWith Donald Trump facing the roughest stretch of his candidacy the media have moved from questioning his sanity to depicting a campaign in disarray and top Republicans still wondering whether they can dump the nomineeThat wont happen of course but its an indication of the toxic nature of the coverage and the flood of antiTrump leaks now washing across the media landscapeTheres a natural pilingon effect when campaigns go off the rails The polls dip the critics step up their rhetoric staffers start pointing fingers and the press keeps the vicious cycle goingBut Ive never seen anything like thisThings reached the point yesterday morning that CNBCs John Harwood tweeted Longtime ally of Paul Manafort Trumps campaign manager Manafort not challenging Trump anymore Mailing it in Staff suicidalAnd there was this from CNN A source tells DanaBashCNN that some Trump campaign staff are frustrated w candidate lately feel like they are wasting their timeI am told by knowledgeable campaign sources that Manafort is not going anywhere and believes that Trump will be getting back on messageI am further told that reports of a planned intervention with the candidate led by Newt Gingrich and Rudy Giuliani are falseAnd the sources also say that contrary to media reports party chairman Reince Priebus is not furious with Trump though he is disappointed with the nominees refusal to endorse Paul RyanTrump and the House speaker appear to have an increasingly tenuous relationship Trump is also refusing to back John McCain one of several Republicans who ripped him for his handling of the Khizr Khan controversyManafort told Foxs Jon Scott that the campaign is in good shapeAsked about reports that outside allies were plotting an intervention with the candidate Manafort said This is the first Im hearing about it adding that some in the media are saying untrue thingsMuch of this grows out the Khan debacle which the media seized upon after his Democratic convention speech about his sons death in Iraq but which Trump then fueled by criticizing a Gold Star familyThat in turn revived fears among Republicans that Trump is too busy picking fights with everyone who insults him to run a disciplined campaign Im told there is frustration within his campaign that he keeps diverting to side issues often in response to cable news chatter rather than staying focused on attacking Hillary ClintonEven Gingrich a close adviser and VP finalist is criticizing his friend while also lambasting media bias He has not made the transition to being the potential president of the United States which is a much tougher league Gingrich told Maria Bartiromo He added that some of what Trump has done is just very selfdestructiveAlong comes ABCs Jonathan Karl reporting that senior party officials are so frustrated  and confused  by Donald Trumps erratic behavior that they are exploring how to replace him on the ballot if he drops outMSNBC ran headlines all day about the Trump intervention but there were no signs it would materializeAll of this has mushroomed into a tsunami of negative media coverage with very little scrutiny of Clinton at least right nowTrump has been at war with the press from the day he got in the race even as he drew enormous amounts of ink and airtime But he cant expand his base simply by bashing the media as satisfying as that may beThe pundits especially the ones on the left and right who detest him are enjoying this latest chance to write him offBut that has proven dangerous in the past And campaign narratives even the most relentlessly negative have a way of changing at a moments noticeHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
