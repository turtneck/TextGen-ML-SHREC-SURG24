The Hill  by Don Rosenburg I always cared about the immigration issue even before my son was killed As a 30year resident of southern California Id been noticing for years the extent to which concrete and sprawl was swallowing up the natural environs of my corner of the state Of all states I always thought why is it the one thats most beautiful and with the most arable and productive land thats being torn up and paved over And just how much traffic and gridlock are people willing to take I would think to myself Then my son in his second year of law school was run over three times and killed by an illegalalien driver Thats when I became an immigrationcontrol activist and thats why I cant support Hillary Clinton  the openborders candidate for president And thats why Ive just filed two lawsuits one against the Department of Homeland Security and one against the Justice Department With the help of the Immigration Reform Law Institute IRLI Im pursuing a complaint against DHS for refusing to consider the environmental impacts of its mass immigration policies a gross violation of environmental law we argue Under the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA all federal agencies must take a hard look at every major action they commit to and produce for the public an environmental assessment which a explores all potential impacts of the action and b considers all possible alternatives Since the law was enacted in 1970 Californias population has doubled from 20 to 40 million and DHS including its predecessor Immigration and Naturalization Services has never published a single report exploring the possible impacts associated with its immigration policies As we argue in our brief if the public knew the effects of runaway population growth maybe they would have rallied that much harder for tougher enforcement and lower immigrationlevels Having ignored their obligations under the statute for so long this could be one the biggest environmental law violations ever committed in the nations history DHS I must add does write some NEPA reports For instance it calculates the impacts caused by its illegalalien detainment facilities just not for the people detained inside them then released to the public This has to be done we argue Americas environmental footprint is gargantuan the biggest in the world only next to dictatorial China The American publics constantly harangued that socalled Dreamers that insufferably inane term simply want an American standard of living and a piece of the American pie But as I used to tell my son as a child wanting is different than needing America is a mere 5 percent of the worlds population yet it consumes 20 percent of its petroleum So every time a legal or illegal alien comes into the country and settles the level of greenhouse gases in the world goes up just a little bit more As for urban sprawl between 1980 and 2000 America paved over a piece of land much of it arable that was around the size of Illinois  But does the correlation between population growth and environmental impact a simple logical connection your average 3rd grader could grasp ever get even a moments discussion in the major media For the future of our kids it must Same goes for illegal aliencrime Routinely were told theres a  scholarly consensus  that illegal aliens commit fewer criminal offenses than citizens As if this could be supportable Most illegal aliens are absolutely skillless and skillless people commit far more crime on averageNever mind for now the labor marketsargument that the last thing our increasingly knowledgebased and roboticized economy needs is more skillless workers And nothing of course is stopping criminals on the run in Mexico from simply relocating here out of the policia s reach In any case we know anyway that illegal aliencrime is a Rumsfeldian known unknown as DOJ apparently doesnt even bother to tally this informationMy sons death was counted as having been killed by a citizen with a drivers license At least for the public that is And thats why IRLI and I are suing them as well The agency has refused to comply with our requests for records on this issue Why they cant divulge to the American public these sorts of facts is telling in itself After all the Justice Department can tell me how many pickpocketing crimes there were last year but not how many people were killed by illegal aliens Not that this should matter in the debate over illegal immigration Since they shouldnt have been here in the first place any crime an illegal alien commits against our own like the killing of my boy is a special tragedy A nightmare that will occur again and again if Hillary Clinton takes the White House Don Rosenberg is the founder of advocacy group Unlicensed to Kill and lives in Los Angeles County
