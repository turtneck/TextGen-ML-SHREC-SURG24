The Iraqi government  supported by Shiite militias from Iran  launched a largescale military operation to take out Islamic State militants from Iraqs western Anbar province MondayThe operation is under way to recapture Fallujah and Ramadi a senior defense official at the Pentagon confirmed to Fox News Monday The efforts are supported by Shiite militias known as Popular Mobilization Units from Iran and its proxy HezbollahPhotos of Irans Quds force Commander Qasem Soleimani visiting Shia militia units inside Iraq have appeared on social media since ISIS took over large portions of Iraq a year agoThe defense official was unaware of any US air support boosting the operation It has been longstanding Pentagon policy to support only units aligned with the government of Iraq but the line can be blurred as the chain of command for units operating in Iraq is not always knownThe spokesman for the Joint Operations Command Brig Gen Yahya Rasool said in a televised statement that the operation started at dawn Monday and that government forces are backed by Shiite and Sunni progovernment fightersThe operation met fierce resistance from insurgents who deployed five suicide car bombs and fired rockets to repel their advance on the city of Fallujah about 30 miles west of Baghdad military sources in Anbar told ReutersThere were also reports of fighting around the provincial capital Ramadi captured by Islamic State two months agoThere were also reports of fighting around Ramadi captured by Islamic State two months ago Iraqi forces pushed towards the provincial capital from the west and the south police sources in the province said Islamic State supporters said those advances were repelled by the militantsWhen Shia militia units launched an operation to retake another Sunni stronghold Tikrit in March they did so without support from the USled coalition initially US warplanes only supported the operation when the Shia militia units backed by Iran departed the areaAccording to the latest coalition airstrike report there were two airstrikes in Fallujah over the weekendThis is not the first time the Iraqi government has announced an operation to retake Anbar  where several key towns including the provincial capital Ramadi remain under ISIS control In May authorities announced an operation to retake Ramadi but there has not been any major progress on the ground since thenThe forces arrayed against ISIS are varied according to retired US Army Lt Col Ralph PetersThis is a real mishmosh said Peters a Fox News contributor You have Shia militias  not all of whom get along by the way Iraqi troops police and some Sunni tribesmen Iran is deeply involved in helping them plan and supervising the operation but it is compartmentalized It wont be Sunni tribesmen and Shia militias standing shouldertoshoulder So coordination is going to be a nightmarePeters said retaking Fallujah a much smaller city than Ramadi and closer to Baghdad will be easier Going into Ramadi where ISIS has been dug in for two months and likely boobytrapped buildings will be a dangerous and painstaking process he said And there is one more tactic to worry about according to PetersISIS is very smart he said When they are attacked in one area they strike in another area It would not be surprising to see an asymmetric response  perhaps a new attack on Tikrit or the oil fields in the northHadi alAmeri commander of the largest Shiite force the Badr Organization told Iraqi television Sunday he expected the main attack on Fallujah to happen after the Eid holiday which starts later this weekResidents in Fallujah and Ramadi reported heavy bombardment of both cities early on MondayIn a brief statement Iraqs Prime Minister Haider alAbadi vowed to take revenge from Daesh criminals on the battlefield and their cowardly crimes against unarmed civilians will only increase our determination to chase them and to expel them from the land of IraqThe Islamic State group also known by the Arabic acronym Daesh seized large parts of Anbar in early 2014 and captured Ramadi in May Iraqi forces which had been making steady progress against the extremists in recent months with the help of the air campaign scored a major victory in recapturing Saddam Husseins hometown of Tikrit last monthDuring the past few weeks the troops have been moving to cut the militants supply routes and to surround and isolate Ramadi and FallujahRasool didnt provide any further details on the ongoing operations By noon the countrys state TV reported government forces recapturing villages and areas around FallujahMeanwhile Monday the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Sundays series of bombings in Shiite areas of the capital Baghdad that killed at least 29 people and
