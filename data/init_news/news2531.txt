Donald Trump is forecast to lose Wisconsin and while that doesnt necessarily signal a deeper shift in the race it could be decisive nonethelessHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueRepublican presidential candidate Ted Cruz greets supporters from the back of a pickup truck at a campaign stop at Altoona Family Restaurant in Altoona Wis last weekIt was Republican opponents of Donald Trump said at the time a lastditch rallying cry to prevent the mercurial billionaire from winning the GOP presidential nomination and effectively taking over the partyFive weeks later NeverTrump is still trending  and the Republican movement to derail the Trump train faces its moment of truth Tuesday in the Wisconsin primary Conservative groups have spent millions of dollars on television and radio attack ads Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker a onetime contender for the nomination has rallied support for Texas Sen Ted Cruz Mr Trumps top opponent In Milwaukee whose suburbs are rich with Republican voters conservative talk radio hosts have been skewering Trump relentlesslyHonestly If Donald Trump does win in Wisconsin I dont know how hes possibly stoppable says Charlie Sykes Wisconsins top conservative radio voice speaking Monday on MSNBCBut I do think that people are going to look back at Wisconsin and say All right this is exactly what it will take to stop Donald Trump from being the Republican nominee There are indications that Wisconsin could indeed slow Trumps momentum One key poll has Senator Cruz 10 points upFor his part Mr Sykes says the leadup to Wisconsin has uncovered a formula for stopping Trump that includes a new willingness by the media to drill down on issues with Trump  as MSNBC host Chris Matthews did last week on abortion Trump said he believed women should be punished for having abortions then quickly reversed himself after an uproar ensuedBut many of Wisconsins lessons about how to beat Trump are particular to the state Its deeply ingrained sense of civility as well as its relatively higher levels of education and religious adherence all play to Trumps weaknessesIn the end Wisconsins biggest contribution to the NeverTrump movement could simply be in denying him the delegates he needs to win a majority by the Republican National Convention this summer At the convention Trumps chances of securing the nomination will plummet if he cant do it on the first ballotIn Wisconsin Trump has been his own worst enemy with a brash style that clashes with the states culture of civilityEven when Scott Walker was battling the unions in 2011 and 100000 people were marching around the capitol those were familyfriendly events says Barry Burden a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin Madison There were massive policy disagreements but not a lot of personal insultsTrumps recent retweet of an unflattering picture of Cruzs wife Heidi is just one example of his tonedeaf approach in Wisconsin the only state voting Tuesday Trumps repeated attacks on Walker and on the Republican speaker of the House Paul Ryan of Wisconsin have also baffled observers as both men are popular among the states RepublicansTrump is running into the buzzsaw of a state GOP that coalesced around Walker during his clashes with public unions and the subsequent recall election in 2012 which the governor survived followed by his reelection in 2014That means theres not a rump group of the party ready to bolt to go to Trump says Charles Franklin director of the Marquette University Law School poll Last week the poll showed Cruz beating Trump 40 to 30 percentOn the plus side for Trump Wisconsin does not register voters by party and allows sameday registration So firsttime or infrequent voters inspired by Trumps message can easily turn out for himUltimately observers still expect Cruz to win though there are important demographic reasons not to put too much stock in a Cruz victory Nate Cohn a specialist on voter analytics at The New York Times points to several factors that have always spelled trouble for Trump in Wisconsin includingEducation The state is average or above average in every educational category while support for Trump skews toward those with less education Wisconsin is unusual in that many of its most strongly Republican areas are welleducated suburbs Mr Cohn notesReligion Wisconsin is also a bit above average for religious adherence and with the exception of white Roman Catholics Trump fares worse in areas where larger shares of the population are reported to be religious adherents Cohn writesFamily Trump also fares worse in areas with strong traditional families Wisconsin has an aboveaverage number of married couplesAncestry Wisconsins population skews toward those from predominantly Protestant countries in Northern Europe a demographic in which Trump has struggled Cohn reportsIn short Wisconsin Republicans are similar demographically to those in Iowa Kansas and Utah all states where Cruz beat Trump  who then reboundedThe key for Trump will be to recover quickly if he loses Wisconsin The calendar both helps and hurts him The next contest isnt until April 19 so he potentially faces two weeks of being cast as a loser The good news for him is that the next contests are on friendlier turf  his home state of New York followed by PennsylvaniaBut if Trump loses Wisconsin badly enough that he earns no delegates his path to clinching the Republican nomination before the convention becomes steeper Then his biggest failing as a candidate  his weak organization  could come into playHe has a dearth of insiders both nationally and inside the state parties who can defend his interests in delegate allocationTrump has already reportedly been losing delegates to Cruz whose operation is going after those who are uncommitted or won by candidates no longer in the raceTrump has attempted to address this by bringing in veteran Republican strategist Paul Manafort to wrangle delegates at the convention a major getThe third remaining GOP candidate Ohio Gov John Kasich remains an important factor preventing Trump and Cruz from going against each other oneonone Governor Kasich appears to have benefited from the departure of Florida Sen Marco Rubio from the race March 15 He scored 21 percent in the latest Marquette poll up from 8 percent in late February and is the choice of oldergeneration GOP leaders in the state including former Gov Tommy Thompson and former Rep Scott KlugPolling shows Kasich beating Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton in the general election in November while both Cruz and Trump lose to Mrs ClintonAt least at the moment he seems to have a better chance at preventing another Clinton presidency says Rich Bonomo an engineering researcher at the University of Wisconsin MadisonKasich trails far behind Trump and Cruz in the delegate count and the only way he can win the GOP nomination is through a contested convention But for some Wisconsin voters Kasich is an important option  the only candidate left with executive branch governing experience and moremoderate Republican policiesRebecca Forbes Wank bookkeeper for the University of Wisconsin press says she doesnt like Cruz because hes so far to the right And she cant vote for Trump in part because the way hes been running has made it OK for people to be racistThat leaves her with Kasich In ultraliberal Madison Trump and Cruz supporters are few and far between but in the wider state they are the ballgame And after Tuesday Republicans nationally will be one step closer to knowing whether theyre headed for a contested convention
