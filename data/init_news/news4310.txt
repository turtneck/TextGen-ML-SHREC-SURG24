Sunday morning I have a lot of fans and they were not happy about it And this was a very obnoxious guy who was a troublemaker who was looking to make troubleIn their current state of outrage about antiracism protests at Americas colleges and universities political correctness and Black Lives Matter activism movement conservatives are refighting the Culture Wars of the 1960s and 1980s Once more the university is their enemy both because of the American rights deeply rooted antiintellectualism as well as how it is one of the few spaces where women gays and lesbians and people of color are incorrectly imagined as having a voice and some pittance of powerBecause conservatives exhibit a high degree of social dominance behavior any threat to what they view as the natural order of things is met with fear a sense of victimization and feelings of hostility This dynamic helps to explain the rightwings current obsession with political correctness and safe spaces It also reveals the glaring difference between how movement conservatives and liberally minded people understand the world and the language they use to describe itAs originally used and intended by liberals and progressives a safe space is one where nonwhites gays and lesbians women the differentlyabled and other stigmatized groups and individuals can be momentarily free from harassment marginalization and discriminationLiberals use the phrase political correctness to describe a basic principle that individuals should try to treat one another with dignity and respectConservatives who of course practice their own type of ideological orthodoxy as political correctness are enraged by these notions because they view them as a limitation on their ability to demean harass and abuse other peopleMoreover conservatives are especially upset by political correctness because it is often an assertion of agency and a demand for respect from marginalized groups against dominant white male institutional authority The divergent reaction to safe spaces and political correctness from conservatives and liberals also signals to another sociopolitical fact American society is structured around maintaining promoting and protecting unearned advantages life opportunities and resources for white people As viewed through the lens of the color line almost every aspect of American life is a safe space for white people This safe space for whiteness is reinforced by many factors including but not limited to the mass media residential and housing segregation racially homogeneousinterpersonal social networks as well as a racist criminal justice system And when this protective bubble of white privilege is pierced or in any way challenged many white folks respond in extremely negative hostile and immature ways When people tell and show you who they really are you had best pay close attention When Black Lives Matter protesters exercised their constitutionally protected right of free speech at Hillary Clintons and Bernie Sanders rallies earlier this year they were not physically assaulted by those in attendance In contrast when Black Lives Matter and other protesters have intervened at Donald Trump rallies they have been met with thuggish violence by his public It is also telling that Donald Trumps supporters began to triumphantly yell all lives matter while Mercutio Southall Jr was taken away by police This slur is a rejection of the basic principle driving Black Lives Matter AfricanAmericans should have same the full and equal human rights protections and freedoms as whites Any other civic arrangement should be unacceptable in a country that purports to be the greatest country on Earth To stand against Black Lives Matter is to agree that black people should in fact be second class citizens in their own country Consequently it has become abundantly clear in recent months that All Lives Matter is the new White Power for the Age of Obama Research on political attitudes values and American history has repeatedly demonstrated the many ways that conservatism and racism is now the same thing in postcivil rights era America The rise of the Tea Party the GOPs extreme rightward shift vicious and ugly racially driven animus and conspiracy theories towards Barack Obama the efforts to destroy the gains of the civil rights movement and now the KnowNothinglike xenophobia and prejudice against nonwhite immigrants and Syrian refugees are current events as an example of the Republican Partys white supremacist orientation and brand This is seen online as well The YouTube clip of the fracas in Birmingham Alabama has hundreds of commentsmany of them are overtly racist use racially violent antiblack language lie about how Black Lives Matter is a terrorist organizationand deploy the slogans White Power and All Lives Matter interchangeably And because he appeals to the most strident immature and reactionary part of the American rightwing id Donald Trumps rallies are safe spaces  for nativism white racism and increasingly violence
