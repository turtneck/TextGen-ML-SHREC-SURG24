Silvers model gives Trump a 19 percent chance of winning the election Right now he has Clinton taking the popular vote by seven points and absolutely crushing Trump in the Electoral College 353 to 184 Considering that the polarized electorate means each candidate is starting out with a floor of probably 50 million or so votes these numbers indicate Trump is performing no better against Clinton than a rock covered in orange spray paint would The GOPs only chance might be to toss him overboard at the convention and nominate an inanimate carbon rodIf nothing else the reduction of this election to the numbers for each candidate reminds us that for all the sturm und drang up to this point this election is like every other presidential election a fight between two candidates and two competing visions As much as Trump can be said to have any vision anyway For anyone exhausted by the screaming and unpleasantness of this Democratic primary campaign it is nice to now catch our breath beneath the solid foundation of math before the conventions and the official general election kickoff sprays us all with its stink Because Trumps ego isnt going to take losing very well And if the NRAs new antiClinton ad is any indication neither are the lunatics who have thrown their support behind himBut if the poll numbers arent enough for you there is the reaction to them by Trump deadenders who at this point are the equivalent of flight attendants passing out peanuts and ginger ale while oxygen masks are dropping from the ceiling the pilot is openly sobbing over the intercom and both wings are on fireFor example Roy Edroso points us to this post over at the conservative blog Powerline which contains this gem of a paragraphIt is a bit early to be pulling out the Our candidate would have this election in the bag if we just allowed only white people to vote line Mitt Romney at least had the decency to wait until after he lost the 2012 election to take that data point for a walk in public Or take this one from National Reviews Rich Lowry who finds it remarkable Trump is competitive in battleground states considering that he is not running a real campaign For one thing this is not true Polls show Trump getting crushed in battleground states For another Lowrys evidence for Trumps remarkable effort is that Clinton has spent 140 million on ads in battleground states while Trump has spent  wait for it  nothing Literally he has spent less on ads in battleground states than I spent on lunch on Wednesday What Lowry misses is that the 140 million is mostly reserved time in the future Clinton spent 26 million running battleground state ads in June The remaining 114 million has been spent on airtime for ads that will run in the future In other words Trumps numbers are already sinking and the Clinton campaign has yet to unleash a good 80 percent of its ad buy to date Of course Silver has been wrong before mostly because he didnt want to believe his own polling model This time he is actually accepting what the polls are telling him And there is plenty of evidence to back him up National polls consistently give Clinton the lead and show Trumps support cratering All of that said of course there are always unknown or unforeseen events that could throw everything into chaos But at the end of the day this is still a choice between two people one of whom is wildly unpopular terrifying and embarrassing to the majority of voters For all the easily panicked liberals who worry about not taking Trump seriously right now the signs point to a comfortable Clinton win Thats not wishful thinking Its math Everyone take a deep breath There may be four months and lots of ugliness to get through and it is imperative that the electorate still goes out and demolishes not just Trump but the toxic brew of nativism and xenophobia that is Trumpism But the end of this whole mishigas of an election is almost in sight
