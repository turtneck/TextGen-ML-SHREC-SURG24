Mostparents will do just about anything for their children especially when it comes to education Predictably at a time when college costs are exploding and students are staggering under more than 1 trillion in debt one opportunistic lender is making huge profits on loans to their doting moms and dadsLess predictably that lender is the United States governmentThe fastgrowing federal program known as Parent PLUS now serves 32 million borrowers who have racked up 65 billion in debt helping their kids go to school The loans have much in common with the regular student loans that have created a national debt crisis and a 2016 campaign issue but PLUS has much higher interest rates and fees and far fewer opportunities for loan forgiveness or reductionsIn fact the PLUS program which includes similar loans to graduate students is the most profitable of the 120 or so federal lending programs That sounds like a good thing until you remember the governments profit comes from its own citizens often citizens of modest meansParent PLUS was created in 1980 to provide small loans to help reasonably welloff families finance the American Dream of an undergraduate education But in an era of skyrocketing education costs it has grown to look a lot like publicly funded predatory lending providing almost any borrowers with almost unlimited cash to attend any school with almost no regard to their ability to repay Thirteen percent of undergraduates now rely on Parent PLUS and many of their parents are falling into debt trapsYou feel so guilty that you havent done enough for your kid and they make it so easy to get the loans said Elizabeth Hill a 57yearold property appraiser from the Boston suburbs with more than 30000 inPLUSdebt Then theyve got you by thecojones Its like The Sopranos except its the governmentFor all the controversy swirling around student loans lending money directly to students at least has a human capital rationalesince recipients pursue degrees that can boost their earning power and help them fulfill their obligationsBut when parents borrow theyre often taking on new debts just as their earning power is starting to dwindle Theyre not building human capital Theyre just getting closer to retirement mortgaging their futures on behalf of their childrenAndif they default the government can garnish their wages and even their Social Security checks  less brutal than The Sopranos but just as effectiveAccording to the White House budget office the expected recovery rate for defaulted Parent PLUS loans is a remarkable 106 percent a testament to Uncle Sams unique power as a collection agency Overall the program is expected to return 123 on every dollar it lends this year thanks to its relatively high interest rates and minimal opportunities for debt relief as well as the governments relentlessness in tracking down overdue education loans The only federal loans that generate slightly better returns are the similar PLUS loans to graduate students which have much lower default ratesPOLITICO has been investigating thegovernmentsbizarre 33trillion loan portfoliowhich is riddled with tensions between the interests of borrowers and taxpayers Some credit programs are almost comically risky for the government most memorably a rural broadband effort with an official default rate of a seemingly impossible 116 percentParentPLUSloans are the flip side of the coin generating reliable profits fortaxpayers butserious risks for moderateincome borrowersJust about everyone I interviewed thought Congress should consider major reforms toParentPLUSwhen it takes up a higher education bill thisfall butno one was too optimistic that reforms would passlargely because of those profitsParentPLUSis classic predatory lending Its not a safe product for many of these families and the debts will hound them forever said Rachel Fishman an education policy analyst at the nonpartisan New America think tank But its a cash cow for the government so its going to be extremely difficult to reformParentPLUSis not a trap for everyone The latest data suggest that only 5 percent of borrowers are defaulting within their first three years of repayment although that figure is rising rapidly TheWhite House budget tablessuggest the expected default rate over the course of the loans is well above 10 percent which is still well below the rate for regular student loans Theres a wealth of evidence that college degrees boost lifetime earnings and defenders of Parent PLUS say its an important tool for increasing college graduation rates PLUS loans have also become a key revenue source for many schools particularly historically black colleges and forprofits that tend to serve lowerincome familiesBut that just illustrates the increasingly tortured economic paradoxes at the heart of modern higher education where schools have no incentive to provide affordable prices as long as they can count on federal dollars for makingeducation affordableUltimately ParentPLUSsluices more cash into the collegeindustrial complex helping educators jack up their tuitions while pressuring parents to make up the difference with debt while doing nothing to ensure theyre getting a real return on their investment It enhances accessibility but not really affordability simply givingparents a way to puntthe skyrocketing costs into the futureEven some advocates who fiercely defended Parent PLUS during a highprofile controversy in 2011when the Obama administration briefly reined inloans toparents with sketchy credit histories told me the program is deeply troubled and inherently flawedWhen I spoke to White House education adviser Roberto Rodriguez about this conundrum he emphasized that President Barack Obama has crusaded to make America the worlds leader in access to higher education expandingPell grants to lowincome students and incomebased repayment for burdensome student loans while proposing to make community college free Parent PLUS he said is another important tool to help young people pursue a better life But he also said hesconcerned that too many struggling parents are getting in too deep When I asked him if the Education Department was running a predatory lending program he didnt say noThats the heart of the matter Rodriguez said You want to expand access and choice but you also want to make sure families can afford these loansHILL AND HER husband are solidly middle class and proudly thrifty she drives a 15yearold minivan and shops at TJ Maxx She and her husband put away money for their son Aarons education and though they burned through some savings when Hill lost her job early in the Great Recession they figured theyd be fine when Aaron chose the University of Massachusetts at Amherst over several private colleges He also won some academic grants and maxed out on federal student loans But even a public school like UMass cost 25000 a yearHill just couldnt make the numbers workUntil suddenly she could Hill discovered she was eligible forParentPLUS which would cover whatever Aarons grants and loans didnt At the time Hill felt like she had won something even though the loans are entitlements for anyone without a recent history of adverse credit She feels differently now that Aaron has moved back home with his degree and taken a job at a local liquor store  and her husband may have to postpone his plans for retirement to make ends meetYoure at your wits end you want to help your kid and this fairy princess appears on your computer and says Want some money Hill recalled Youre like Bingo Its more than you can afford but dammit education is important right Then four years later you cant believe how much you oweWhen Congress created Parent PLUS 35 years ago the loans were capped at 3000 per year until that was lifted in 1992 so families could borrow as much as they wanted toward the cost of attendance at any public or private school But the rules do not allow colleges to ask about their income or their ability to pay And the borrowers dont have to start making payments until the student leaves school although the interest accumulates the whole timeCongress set the maximum interest rate at 9 percent in 1980 which seemed generous at a time when mortgage rates were skyrocketing toward 18 percent but Parent PLUS is no longer a particularly attractive deal for families with other options The current rates are about 7 percentplusa 4 percent origination fee a lot lower than credit card debt or payday loans but a lot higher than subsidized student loansI figured the rate wasnt terrible and the money was so easy to get said Debbie Hounanian a 56yearold office manager in the Los Angeles suburbs who racked up 54000 inParentPLUSdebt I had no idea what I was getting intoToday the averageParentPLUSloan is about 13000 and manyparents pile up much larger debts now that some schoolscost more than 50000 a year The loans are almost impossible to discharge in bankruptcy just like student loans but theyre ineligible for most of the incomebased paymentrelief available for student loans Consumer advocates compare them to subprime mortgages before the bust encouraging families to bite off more debtthan they can chew  exceptthat ParentPLUSalso has a government imprimaturToby Merrill who runs a Harvardaffiliated legal services clinic that focuses on predatory lending recalls one readytoretire borrower who contacted her after running up 150000 inPLUSdebt on three childrenThe question was What are my options Merrill said It was sad because the answer was You dont really have optionsAS STATE AID for higher education has plunged while the cost of college has escalatedPLUSloans have become an increasingly routine method of filling the gap with about 700000 new loans every year Some schools actually includePLUSin their financial aid offers tellingparents theyve qualified to take out say 20000 inPLUSloans a rather disingenuous way of saying the actual offer will leave them 20000 short of the schools official cost of attendance Colleges with tight budgets have little incentive to tell students they cant afford to enroll and strong incentives to encourage students to load up onPLUSloans that pass directly into their coffers The president of Albany State University in Georgia even admitted at a public hearing that cashstrapped colleges have been steering students from student loans into more onerous and expensiveParentPLUSloans because theyre required to report default rates for student loans but not forParentPLUSThe 2011 controversy over Parent PLUS when the Obama administration temporarily tightened the programs lax vetting process illuminated the extent to which colleges and families have become dependent on the cashIt erupted after the Education Departments financial aid office finally recognized a longstanding absurdity the adverse credit reviews forPLUSapplicants were flagging some delinquent debts but not debts that were so delinquent they had been sent to collection agencies or written off As a result many applicants were getting loans with worse credit than rejected applicantsIt made no sense said Ben Miller who was a senior policy adviser at the department during thePLUSflap and is now director of postsecondary education at the leftleaning Center for American Progress But fixing the problem had a much bigger impact than anyone realized it wouldQuietly the department started counting more bad debts in its credit reviews  andPLUSrejection rates soared Studentswho couldnt renew their loans begandropping out of school And schools that relied heavily onPLUSrevenue began hemorrhaging cash At historically black colleges and universities which had been particularly hardhit by the recession the number ofPLUS recipients dropped 45 percent over the next two years depriving them of an estimated 150 million Three struggling black collegesin Virginia Georgia and North Carolina  ended up shutting their doors and larger schools like Morehouse endured mass layoffsOur schools were screaming bloody murder said Thurgood Marshall College Fund President Johnny C Taylor Jr a leading advocate for historically black colleges and universities Forget salt  this was pouring acid in our woundsForprofit schools absorbed an even bigger hit a 54 percent decline inPLUS enrollment But for obvious political reasons the black schools with fierce support from the Congressional Black Caucus led the fight to get the first AfricanAmerican president to reverse or at least delay the changes Taylor and other advocates had several tense meetings with Education Secretary Arne Duncan repeatedly asking why a twodecadeold snafu had to be corrected immediately why the tougher reviews couldnt be limited to new PLUSapplicants why a secretary who had said expanding access to college would be his North Star was restricting access to college Duncan emphasized that the changes werent directed at black schools but Taylor shot back that they were having a disproportionate effect on black schoolsThe secretary kept saying My lawyers are telling us to do this were doing our best to work it out Taylor said Give me a break We were trying to revive a community with double the unemployment rate of the majority communityEventually Duncan publicly apologized to black college leaders for the abruptness of the changes acknowledging that communication internally and externally was poor He promised to consider appeals from all rejected PLUSapplicants and launched a process to write newPLUScredit rulesIt was an operational screwup of epic proportions said Justin Draeger president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators But it was a pretty good reminder thatParentPLUShelps a lot of people pay for collegeIn 2014 the department announced the newPLUSrules essentially reversing its efforts to tighten credit checks Bad debts are no longer grounds for rejection if theyre less than 2085 versus 500 in the old rule or less than two years old versus five years The department didnt even require loan counseling for allPLUSborrowers just those who managed to get loans despite adverse creditIts a shame Mostparents would be better off taking a second mortgage said Natalia Abrams director of the advocacy group Student Debt Crisis Instead theyre getting trapped They assume that if the government is offering these loans they must be safeTo my surprise Taylortold me he agrees Taylor was probably the most outspoken critic of the administrations shortlived efforts to rein inParentPLUS and he still believes it was unfair to change the rules so suddenly after a brutal downturn But he asked me not to describe him as aParentPLUSdefender He said the program is so exploitative that he once investigated a classaction lawsuit but found that debtravagedparents were too ashamed to go publicIts a horrible program totally out of control he said Weve got to figure out a way to make college affordable butParentPLUSis definitely not the answerOBAMAS NEW CONSUMER Financial Protection Bureau has raised alarms about predatory lending by bankers and mortgage brokers At a recent event Richard Hunt the president of the Consumer Bankers Association posed a question to CFPB Director Richard Cordray Why arent you doing anything aboutParentPLUS Cordray replied that he didnt have jurisdiction over the federal government but Hunt believes that if one of his members offered a similar loan product with similarly negligible underwriting standards the bureau would be all over itThe silence has been deafening Hunt said Its sinister to see the government throw money at people with no clue if they can pay it backHunt would like to see the private sector  that ishis members  take over the business And some private lenders are starting to compete withParent PLUS  one Rhode Island bank is offering a similar product with a much lower interest rate of 3 percent and no origination fees for the mostcreditworthy borrowers But whilePLUSloans dont have the same protections as federal student loans they do include some options most private banks wont match like the ability to defer payments for yearsWhatPLUSlacks is flexibilityParents who qualify can borrow whatever they need for their kids to attend whatever school they want whileparents who get rejected cant borrow a dime In another hearing anadministrator of a North Carolina college shareda sad vignette about a homeless woman who was denied aPLUSloan implicitly suggesting the government should have extended her virtually unlimited credit In fact thats exactly what would have happened if her credit had been clean Nobody would have been allowed to try to gauge whether her income or assets gave her any hope of repaymentParentPLUSsuffers from a paradox that also afflicts government loans for agriculture shipbuilding and just about everything else Its highly risky for borrowers who need itmostdesperately whiletheborrowers whocould most easily handle the debtcould probably get by without itMany critics argue thatParentPLUSshould be abolished and that the government should expand Pell grants and raise caps on student loans instead But even those who want to continue the program  including Rodriguez in the White House and Republican staffers on Capitol Hill  seem to agree there are relativelyobviousways to strengthen it The most evident would be real underwriting standards to evaluate the ability to pay of potential borrowers Another would be strict loan caps Or a combination of those reforms could link the creditworthiness of borrowers to the size of the loans theyre eligible to receive thekind of calculation real banks makeEven Draeger who represents aid administrators at 3000 colleges and universities said the system needs structural changes to protect vulnerable familiesWe definitely support new underwriting standardsParents are getting in too deep and its affecting their ability to retire and enjoy life he said Right now schools just have to follow the rules and from a consumer protection standpoint the rules are dangerousThe major obstacle to reform beyond Washingtons general dysfunction and polarization is the immense profitability ofParentPLUSThese days the government borrows money at almost no cost so lending at 7 percent plus fees can add up Parent PLUS could reduce the deficit by 3 billion this yearThat means any effort to scale it back and restrict it to creditworthy borrowers would cost the governmenta lot of money Politicians generallydont like paying more money to provide fewer benefits especially when a wellorganized political coalition has defendedthose benefits in the pastThats the perversity of a loan program like this one senior GOP aide said It makes it that much harder to fixIn other words Washington has become as dependent onParentPLUSloans as the schools that flack them and theparents who receive them The status quo hastremendouspower becauseCongress likes profitable programs schools like reliable revenue andparents like to help their kidsHill and her husband have another son getting ready to start Ithaca College just as theyre starting to pay back Aarons loan but theyre determined to help out again They havent figured out how theyre going to do that yet becausetheres no way theyregoing back to theParentPLUSwell againFool me once right Hill said I dont want to put my kid in a bind but these loans areridiculous The guilt system only goes so far
