Hillary Rodham Clinton  who has spent much of her campaign embracing the policies of President Obama  signaled clear disagreement with her former boss Wednesday in key areas of foreign policy suggesting in some cases that he has been too hesitantAgain and again Clinton pointed to instances overseas where she would have taken a tougher stance than Obama from arming Syrian rebels to confronting an expansionist Russia In some cases she was talking about policy debates she lost while serving as Obamas firstterm secretary of state or about advice she suggested was not heededThe critique delivered as part of a Washington speech focused on the Iran nuclear deal was in many respects subtle  wrapped inside overall praise for Obama and never targeting him directly But the differences were nonetheless striking for a candidate who has worked carefully to soften her hawkish national security reputation and who badly needs Obamas liberal coalition of voters to gain the White HouseThose of us who have been out there on the diplomatic front lines know that diplomacy is not the pursuit of perfection Clinton said Its the balancing of riskThat line was meant to answer Republican critics who say the Obama administration failed to drive a hard bargain in international nuclear talks with Iran But Clinton echoed some GOP criticism of Obamas handsoff approach to some world problemsThe decision to distance herself from Obama on some foreignpolicy issues comes at a difficult time for the Democratic frontrunner who has seen her lead erode amid the rise of an iconoclastic challenger Sen Bernie Sanders IVt and the worsening controversy over her use of a private email server while secretary of stateIt also represents a delicate balancing act for Clinton who has sought to focus on her tenure as the top US diplomat during Obamas first term as a crucial qualification for becoming commander in chief Much of the Democratic Partys progressive wing remains skeptical of her sometimes hawkish tilt on foreign policy including her nowdisavowed vote in favor of the Iraq warHow Clinton is banking on the Obama coalition to winClinton reviewed some of her policy differences with Obama in her State Department memoir Hard Choices published last year But Wednesdays speech at the Brookings Institution was the first time she had gone significantly beyond the mild and often implicit criticisms in that book to question foreignpolicy decisionmaking after she left the administrationThe main goal of Wednesdays wideranging foreignpolicy address was to support the Iran deal against Republican criticism and make clear that if elected president she will enforce it and seek to strengthen itObama deserves praise for his leadership in seeking the deal Clinton said and she claimed some credit for helping open the door for the negotiations that produced the accord this summerEither we move forward on the path of diplomacy and seize this chance to block Irans path to a nuclear weapon or we turn down a more dangerous path leading to a far less certain and riskier future Clinton saidBut Clintons support for the deal came with caveats starting with whether it could lead to rapprochement with Iran after more than 35 years of enmity Clinton was also blunt in her skepticism that Iran will fully comply with the accord limiting but not ending its nuclear program but she said there are adequate safeguards built inShe zeroed in on what critics of the deal call a chief weakness  a concession to Iran that allows a delay of up to 24 days before international inspectors could check up on some kinds of suspected violationsId be the first to say that this part of the deal is not perfect Clinton said But our experts tell us that even with delayed access to some places this deal does the jobJake Sullivan a top Clinton aide who helped launch the Iran negotiations and is now the senior policy adviser for Clintons presidential campaign said she was not suggesting that the administration caved on inspectionsAcknowledging the imperfections of the deal is not criticism of the deal but rather an argument that enforcement must be vigilant Sullivan told reporters after the speechHow Hillary Clinton is running against parts of her husbands legacyOther pieces of direct or implicit criticism flared throughout the speech and during a questionandanswer session afterwardOn Russia Clinton said she had warned of trouble on the horizon with the return of Vladimir Putin as president I am in the category of people who wanted us to do more in response to the annexation of Crimea and the continuing destabilization of Ukraine she said referring to Russias military moves thereClinton said she would sustain a robust military presence in the Persian Gulf The Obama administration has acknowledged that there will be a gap of about two months this fall when no US aircraft carrier group will be stationed in the gulf the first time that has happened in several yearsOn Syria Clinton noted that she argued for arming moderate Syrian rebels far earlier than the White House eventually tried to do and she suggested the United States is not leading as it should in response to an exodus of refugees fleeing the civil war there She proposed organizing a pledging conference like one she helped put together after the 2011 earthquake in Haiti to take in refugees and pay for resettlementThe United States has to be at the table has to be leading it Clinton saidIn response to a question Clinton also suggested that her former boss had miscalculated by trying to strongarm Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over dealings with the Palestinians That tactic was tried during and after her tenureFor Hillary and Bibi a long and sometimes fraught relationshipWell I think theres a lot of room for tough love particularly in private Clinton said But I just dont think its a particularly productive approach for the United States to take in publicIn the absence of you know some kind of greater goal that we were trying to achieve by doing that I just dont think that is the smartest approach she saidClinton was measured but still critical on whether the administration should have pulled back from its request that Congress authorize military force in Syria It opted instead for a 2013 agreement to remove chemical weapons from that countryIts always difficult in hindsight to say what could have happened if something different had been done she said of the debate over how to respond to allegations that Syrian President Bashar alAssads forces had launched chemicalweapons attacks on civilians The vote may well have failed she noted which would have left Obama to decide whether to proceed with punitive airstrikes on his own executive authority and over congressional objectionsI do think that not being able to follow through on it cost us I am certain of that That still comes back in conversations that people have with me at home and abroad Clinton said But I do think it was a net positive to get as much of the chemical weapons out as we could
