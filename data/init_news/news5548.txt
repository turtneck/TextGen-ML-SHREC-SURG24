Scientists have heard unusual messages from deep space probably coming from aliens Please scroll down for video Recently scientists have heard unusual messages from the most distant stars in the observable universe that they think are extraterrestrial Upon new analysis of strange modulations in a tiny set of stars 234 out of 25 million stars that have been observed during past surveyance of the sky new evidence has been found that this tiny fraction of stars is behaving oddly Aliens Are Trying To Make Contact With Us From Distant Stars Scientists Say The new study reports the finding of specific modulations in just 234 out of the 25 million stars that have been observed during a survey of the sky The work found that a tiny fraction of them seemed to be behaving strangely No obvious explanation has been concluded for what is going on leaving the scientists observing these phenomena theorizing that aliens are in fact trying to alert us to their existence We find that the detected signals have exactly the shape of an extraterrestrial intelligence signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in agreement with this hypothesis  write EF Borra and E Trottier in a new paper on this study The Astronomical Society of the Pacific has published the journal under the title Discovery of peculiar periodic spectral modulations in a small fraction of solartype stars Originally it was suggested that it be named Signals probably from Extraterrestrial Intelligence according to a preprint version of the paper hosted online  Like with all scientific theories further research will need to be undertaken to confirm or deny that hypothesis This will be achieved by watching for the same signals using different technology so that many other possibilities of what it could be can be eliminated Earlier this year an initiative called breakthrough listen was set up to search for alien life which has even been supported by both Stephen Hawking and Mark Zuckerberg Although they agree this news is promising they also state that further evidence must be found before these signals can be unequivocally attributed to aliens The one in 10000 objects with unusual spectra seen by Borra and Trottier are certainly worthy of additional study  the team said in a statement However extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence In fact Internationally agreedupon protocols for searches for evidence of advanced life beyond Earth SETI require anomalies to be confirmed by independent groups using their telescopes and extraterrestrial agents can only be considered as an explanation when all natural phenomena are ruled out This article Scientists have heard unusual messages from deep space probably coming from aliens is free and open source You have permission to republish this article under a Creative Commons license with full attribution and a link to the original source on Disclosetv Related Articles
