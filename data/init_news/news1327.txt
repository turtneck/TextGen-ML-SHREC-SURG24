The big release of the latest National Review edition with a cover declaring Against Trump on Thursday night was above all other things a wonderful gift not just to liberals but anyone who lives outside of the conservative tribe Because itgives us a glimpse however temporary of what it feels like to be a Trump supporterI defy readers to take one look at the cover and not feel an overwhelming surge of contempt for these establishment conservatives who love to pander to the camocrowd when it suits them but get fussy when the rubes rise up and start demanding real skin in the game You want to rub their smug little faces right in Donald Trumps ridiculous hair and ask how they like those applesAny discerning reader knows that on some level youre meant to root for the monster to turn on Dr Frankenstein for the Pied Piper to take the children away for Satan to finally come for Dr Faustus And so its impossible not to take pleasure in watching the conservative base come extract its pound of Trumpshaped flesh out of the establishmentIts no mystery why the National Review and their supporters hate Trump Hes vulgar and embarrassing and he does an even better job of exploiting the rightwing rubes and their racism and theirprovincialism and their ridiculous sense of oppression than they doThey are in other words haters And Trump dismissed them as the haters they are with ease during his press conference Thursday night where he called the National Review a dead paper that almost no one reads anymoreThis impression is driven home by actually reading the issue Theeditors cant quite seem to decide what their exact objections to Trump are Is it that hes driving the right too far in the direction of fascism or that hes a secret liberal in disguise Both Whatever you need to hear The strategy is argument through overwhelming Theyll throw everything theyve got even contradictory stuff at the reader and hope the sheer volume of words impresses them enough to vote for Marco Rubio or Jeb BushThe everythingandthekitchensink strategy produces some hilarious contradictions The main antiTrump editorial written by the editors darkly warns that Trump isnt the racist that his followers think he is Trump says he will put a big door in his beautiful wall an implicit endorsement of the dismayingly conventional view that current levels of legal immigration are fine they write even trying to get the reader to believe that Trumps mass deportation plan is poorly disguised amnestyBut then in the writer roundup were hearing a different story Not since George Wallace has there been a presidential candidate who made racial and religious scapegoating so central to his campaign David Boaz sniffs adding that America aspired to rise above such prejudices and guarantee life liberty and the pursuit of happiness to everyoneSo which is it guys Is Trump offensive because hes too nativist or because hes not devoted enough to keeping the foreigners out Whatever will make you not vote for him I guessA similar question emerges when it comes to the conservative obsession with masculinity which they confuse with strength The editors write that Trump has an astonishing weakness for flattery falling for Vladimir Putin after a few coquettish bats of the eyelashes from the Russian thugOn the other hand Ben Domenech worries that Trump is a tyrannical monarch who he believes is too eager to impose his will on the nation Mona Charen chimes in agreement saying conservatism implies a certain modesty about government So which is it Does a big ego make one weak or is the problem that it makes one too strong and authoritarian Both I guess Depends on if youre more of an anxious masculinity conservative or if youre one who likes to delude yourself into believing youre a libertarian sort Either way dont vote Trump The selfcontradictions are particularly amusing to me at least on the issue of women Charen denounces Trump for his need to constantly to insult and belittle others including or perhaps especially women But she and many of the other writers also warn the reader about Trumps prochoice past insinuating that hes not on board with the antichoice movement A movement may I remind you that is passing mandatory ultrasound and waiting period laws and other medically unnecessary regulations for the purpose of insulting and shaming women This selfimportant National Review manifesto cant even decide how to feel about the practice of insulting and belittling people On one hand as Charen writes they believe its a sign of a pitifully insecure person What then to make of the fact that much of the antiTrump argument is rooted in cheap shots at the man fromthe youreagirl insult regarding his behavior around Putin to Mark Helprinsswipe at Trump for having hair like the tinsel on discarded Christmas trees I guess everyone at the National Review is a pitifully insecure person so why is it only a crime when said insulter is Donald Trump Is it because hes better at it than you guys Its tough to say what the National Review expected out of this besides selling more issues And even that has a strong possibility of backfiring as this attack gave Trump an opportunity to imply with cause that they are using his name to bolster their declining sales If the idea was to pry base voters off Trump good luck with that All this does is confirm base voter suspicions that the conservative establishment sees them as a bunch ofuseful idiots who are to be slapped down the second they start thinking they have a real voice in the movement If the idea was to take a stand and lay out a clear line between the bellicose base and the more refined party elite well thats backfiring too as the RNC reacted to all this by disinviting the National Review to partner with them in the Republican debates In his antiTrump screed Ben Domenech gets on his high horse about how ours is supposed to be a government of the people by the people which he claims Trump is threatening Keep telling yourself that buddy Because it looks a whole lot like Trumps popularity is due to the people revolting against a system where the establishment calls all the shots And National Reviews flailing shows that the establishment has no idea what to do with that
