Email A new poll from an unlikely source suggests that the US public and the US media have very little in common when it comes to matters of war and peace This poll was commissioned by that notorious leftwing hotbed of peaceniks the Charles Koch Institute along with the Center for the National Interest previously the Nixon Center and before that the humorously named Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom The poll was conducted by Survey Sampling International They polled 1000 registered voters from across the US and across the political spectrum but slanted slightly toward older age groups They asked Over the last 15 years do you think US foreign policy has made Americans more or less safe What dear reader do you say If you say less safe you not only agree with dozens of top US officials the week after they retire but you agree with 525 of the people polled Those who said more safe add up to 14 while 252 said about the same and 83 just didnt know Well at least all these humanitarian wars to spread democracy and eliminate weapons and destroy terror have benefited the rest of the world right Not according to the statistics that show terrorism on the rise during the war on terrorism and not according to 505 of poll respondents who said US foreign policy has made the world less safe Meanwhile 126 said more safe while 241 said it was about the same and 128 didnt know Asked about four wars in particular registered US voters said each of them had made the US less secure by a margin of 496 to 209 on Iraq 422 to 189 on Libya 422 to 243 on Afghanistan and 408 to 321 on bombing ISIS in Syria These answers should not immediately be taken to prove that the US public is universally wise and well informed and not coincidentally at odds with US media Not only is that margin pretty slim on ISIS but 433 of those polled said ISIS was the greatest threat the United States faces Meanwhile 141 named Russia 85 North Korea 81 the national debt 79 domestic terrorists and bringing up the rear with the correct answer of global warming as the greatest threat were a grand total of 46 of those polled A survey of US news reports would certainly suggest a point of agreement here between the public and the media But here is where it gets interesting Although the public believes the hype about danger emanating from these foreign forces it does not favor the solution it is endlessly offered by the media and the US government When asked if compared to last 15 years the next president should use the US military abroad less 511 agreed while 242 said it should be used more And 800 said that any president should be required to get congressional authorization before committing the US to military action while 102 rejected that radical idea thats been in the US Constitution since day 1 The US public may look quite depressingly ignorant in a quick survey of Youtube videos but check this out Asked if the US government should deploy US troops on the ground in Syria 511 said no compared to 235 who said yes Only 10 said yes on Yemen while 228 said no  however 407 said the US government should keep supporting Saudi Arabia in that war Good majorities also oppose Japan acquiring nuclear weapons Germany acquiring nuclear weapons or the US defending Taiwan against a Chinese attack Who invents these scenarios This moderately encouraging survey of public sentiment stands in stark contrast to US media coverage of wars in general and Syria in particular The New York Times Nicholas Kristof is ready for a bigger war as are columnists in the Washington Post and USA Today as well as of course Chuck Todd and other televised talking head Meanwhile Hillary Clintons comment to Goldman Sachs that a no fly zone would require killing a lot of Syrians has received dramatically less press than her brave calls for creating a humanitarian no fly zone and the steady depiction of that proposal as doing something in contrast to the only other option doing nothing The public however rejects the only something thats on offer and just might leap at the opportunity to try something else if anyone ever proposed anything else
