  Recipient Email  Enemies of the United States are joyously watching its upcoming elections that are exposing this once great nation as deeply corrupt Its as if a huge rock has been turned over exposing the swarming slithering underside of Americas political system For those who admire America like this writer this week is a time to weep for the republic We see two candidates who are utterly unfit for the highest office Hilary Clinton engulfed by scandals and blustering TV mogul Donald Trump a man of profound shallowness who advocates Islamophobia torture and environmental ignorance Hillary Clintons core supporters are black food stamp and welfare recipients and legions of women who are voting simply by gender Trumps core supporters are taxpaying workers who have watched Wall Street loot Americas economy and send their jobs abroad Like many people Ive been tearing my hair trying to decide for whom to vote I now favor Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson who gained worldwide fame as a dolt when asked about the destruction of Aleppo Syria Whats Aleppo asked this New Mexico Bismarck Now thats the kind of president Id like to see No more regimechangers and empirebuilders No more Imperial America No more crusaders or world super power bullying No more mucking around the world and acting as the globes enforcer Lets forget Aleppo Beirut Gaza Tehran Islamabad the South China Sea and North Korea We can no longer afford to play Game of Thrones Weve got to rebuild bridges and airports and clean the Augean Stables of Congress Americas most corrupt institution We just spent 28 billion on roads in remote Afghanistan while our own highways are crumbling Such is the folly of imperialism The old Soviet Union did something similar allowing its domestic infrastructure and industry to fall apart while adventuring in Afghanistan and deploying 55000 tanks in the Red Army These tanks were useful in putting down the heroic Hungarian Revolution of 1956  60 years ago this week  but for nothing else But I fear that whoever wins the US election will very quickly face major problems for which they are woefully unprepared Most obvious is the bloody mess the US has created across the Mideast I just learned that Trump recently named as Mideast advisor a notorious Muslimhating fanatic who is a Lebanese Maronite Christian fascist His advice will likely be to invade Lebanon and Syria and kill more Muslims For her part Hilary Clinton has long been a whollyfinanced subsidiary of Wall Street and the mighty Israel lobby Just have a look at the list of her largest donors Her proIsrael supporters are urging her to create a socalled nofly zone over Syria which is code for fullscale war against Syrian government and Russian forces Guess who will benefit from Syrias destruction and disintegration This supreme idiocy could lead directly to nuclear war with Russia something Ive been warning against for years There has been no mention in the campaign of rebuilding the Arab world ravaged by western imperial interventions Little mention of some 12 million Syrian refugees created by the Saudis and US Nor of five million Palestinian refugees and who knows how many in Iraq Libya Somalia and now warravaged Yemen And not a word about Americas stalemated war in Afghanistan Nothing about a shaky Europe Nor how to accommodate Chinas rise Instead weve heard tirades against the phony ISIS which is funded by the Saudis and Hilary Clintons absurd claims that wicked Vlad Putin is somehow behind Americas foreign disasters Its stupid and shameful demagoguery At least Trump has the good sense to urge that we end our pointless confrontation with Russia and scale back the unaffordable American Empire Few Americans know that almost half their governments budget is spent on the military Besides disgusting many Americans the presidential campaign has made the US an object of derision and embarrassment around the globe Many analysts claim that this grand fiasco marks the beginning of the end of US global hegemony Its certainly the beginning of the beginning This week alone the Philippines and Malaysia two staunch American allies edged closer to Chinas camp Neither Trump no Clinton had a care for Americas reputation during their ugly debates My fear is that the election vitriol will not end America shame and misery but continue on like an acid eating into the national fabric Reprinted from EricMargoliscom by permission of author or representative
