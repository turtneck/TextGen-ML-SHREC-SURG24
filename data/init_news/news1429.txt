Antonin Scalia was a conservative giant on the Supreme Court His death will affect this Supreme Court term the future balance of the court and the 2016 electionWhy Trump says he wants to ditch plans for new Air Force OneAn American flag flies at halfstaff in front of the US Supreme Court in Washington Sunday morning in honor of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia who died this weekendThe passing of Justice Antonin Scalia substantially undercuts the ability of the United States Supreme Court to decide some of the most contentious national issues currently pending at the high courtIn addition it thrusts the nations highest court into a glaring spotlight in this years presidential election and it sets the stage for a yearlong confrontation between President Obama and Sentate Republicans over not just who should fill the vacant high court seat but how fast the nomination and confirmation process should proceedOn a human level Justice Scalias sudden death Saturday while on a hunting trip in Texas casts a pall over the institution he loved and served for nearly three decades He is being remembered by friends and colleagues as one of the most influential justices in a generation and perhaps in high court historyThey are praising his intellect his wit and a combative style from the bench that had a capacity to endear and enrage He was a gifted writer and at times an uncompromising critic of judges and fellow justices with whom he disagreedHis brilliance and wit not only lit up a pen they lit up a room said Amy Barrett a Notre Dame law professor and former Scalia law clerk in a statementHe was larger than life and it is difficult to imagine life without him in itScalias most enduring contribution to American jurisprudence may ultimately be his selfprofessed fidelity to originalism and his rejection of the concept that the US Constitution is a living document that should be liberally reinterpreted by the courts Instead Scalia preached the virtues of remaining faithful to the text  the actual words  in the Constitution or in a statuteTo Scalia and the growing number of conservative scholars and judges who follow his approach originalism is a safeguard against judges using their lifetime appointments to amend the Constitution or statutes to reflect their personal policy preferencesHe believed that it was for lawmakers to make laws and that it was for judges to confine themselves to giving no greater or lesser force to the resulting measureIn a statement to the nation on Saturday night President Obama praised Scalia as a brilliant legal mind with an energetic style incisive wit and colorful opinionsObama ordered flags across the country to be flown at halfstaff in honor of ScaliaBut the president also made clear that he planned to move forward with a nomination to fill the vacant seat at the high court He called on the Senate to give his nominee a fair hearing and a timely voteThe vacant high court seat is significant because the Supreme Court had been divided with five justices nominated by Republican presidents and four nominated by Democratic presidents Now with Scalias passing the divide is four to fourIf Scalias seat is filled by a more liberalleaning Democratic nominee it could substantially shift the balance of power on the high court in a liberal direction in the full range of hot button issuesIt is for that reason that Democrats are already pushing hard for a relatively quick nomination by Obama and a Senate vote this year on that nomineeFor the same reason Republicans who currently hold a majority of Senate seats are insisting that the nomination and any vote be delayed until after the November presidential electionSenator Chuck Grassley R of Iowa chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a statement that standardpractice for 80 years has been that Supreme Court nominations and confirmations should not proceed during a presidential election yearGiven the huge divide in the country and the fact that this president above all others has made no bones about his goal to use the courts to circumvent Congress and push through his own agenda it only makes sense that we defer to the American people who will elect a new president to select the next Supreme Court justice Senator Grassley saidAs for the ongoing work at the Supreme Court itself what had looked to become one of the most momentous Supreme Court terms in years suddenly looks a lot less soIn the next three months the justices are set to hear cases examining abortion restrictions in Texas the contraception mandate in Obamacare and whether President Obama acted constitutionally in his executive action on immigrationNow with one less vote in the courts conservative wing the court appears split four to four between liberals and conservativesThat doesnt mean there wont be significant decisions For example if Justice Anthony Kennedy joins his liberal colleagues in the Texas abortion case as some analysts expect that could lead to a 5to3 decision striking down all or part of the Texas abortion restrictions That decision could be a landmark and Scalias absence would be felt only in the loss of what would likely be a fiery dissenting opinionBut in the contraceptive mandate case and the Obama immigration cases the loss of Scalias vote could result in a 4to4 tie that would leave the lower court decisions in place Such an outcome would resolve those cases but set no national precedentLegal experts note that decisions in cases that have already been heard in oral argument by the court but not yet publicly announced may change with the loss of Scalias vote Those cases include a dispute testing whether unions representing public employees can require nonmembers to pay fair share fees to a union for collective bargaining Analysts anticipated that the court might rule 5 to 4 against the unions That outcome is now unlikelyIn addition the court was preparing a decision in a case raising a fundamental question about the meaning of one person one vote and how voting districts are drawn in Texas The outcome of that case is now also in doubtThe high court is also considering a potential landmark case examining the use of race in an affirmative action plan at the University of Texas at Austin But the loss of Scalias vote may not undercut a final decision in that case because Justice Elena Kagan is not participating in the dispute So a 4to3 vote is possible
