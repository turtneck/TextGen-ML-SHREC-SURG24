Democratic presidential candidate Sen Bernie Sanders said Sunday that American voters superdelegates and others must take a hard look at the recent federal report that found primary rival Hillary Clintons email setup while running the State Department broke agency rulesIt was not a good report for Secretary Clinton That is something that the American people Democrats and delegates are going to have to take a hard look at Sanders told CBS Face the Nation during one of two TV network interviews SundayThe inspector generals report last week concluded Clinton broke agency rules by using a private email server and that she would have been denied permission to have one had she first sought permissionOn Sunday Sanders desperately trailing the frontrunning Clinton in the delegate count continued to not comment directly on the controversyBut he repeated the notion that superdelegates of which he needs more in a longshot bid to take the nomination should indeed scrutinize the reportI mean everybody in America is keeping it in mind and certainly the superdelegates are Sanders saidThe Clinton campaign said Wednesday that the report shows just how consistent Clintons email practices were with those of other secretaries and senior officials at the State Department who also used personal emailThe campaign also said the report notes that Clintons use of personal email was known to officials within the department and that there is no evidence to show any successful breach of the former secretary of states serverIn a separate interview Sunday with NBCs Meet the Press Sanders said he is focused on the future of the American middle class and how we deal with the fundamental problems they are facingHe also declined to comment on the FBI investigation into the Clinton email scandal including what impact the findings might have on a Clinton general election bidHowever Sanders appeared to perhaps take his concerns about the emails a step further suggesting Americans are tired of those kinds of politicsAnd he made clear presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has and will continue to make an issue of them if and when he faces Clinton directly in the November electionDonald Trump and other Republicans will seize on it he told NBC Theres no doubting that
