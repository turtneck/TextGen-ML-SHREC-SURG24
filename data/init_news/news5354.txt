are eyeing a comebackOn the Democratic side Sen Bernie Sanders of nextdoor Vermont is looking to rebound from his narrow Iowa loss with a big victory over Hillary Clinton And on the Republican side nearly a halfdozen candidates are battling for position behind Donald Trump with the races governors  Chris Christie Jeb Bush and John Kasich  looking for redemption after missing the leaderboard entirely last weekWith votes in from residents of Dixville Notch Millsfield and Harts Landing Trump Ohio Gov Kasich and Texas Sen Ted Cruz shared the Republican lead with nine votes each New Jersey Gov Christie followed with three votes while Florida Sen Marco Rubio and former Florida governor Bush each had two Retired neurosurgeon Dr Ben Carson and former HP CEO Carly Fiorina each garnered one voteOn the Democratic side Sanders led Clinton by 17 votes to 9In a statistical oddity the candidate who receives a plurality of the Republican vote in Dixville Notch population 12 has been the GOP nominee in every election cycle since 1968 This year Kasich won the towns vote 32 over TrumpWith Trump leading the Republican race by double digits in most polls the big question entering Tuesdays primary was whether the relentless attacks againstRubio during and after Saturday nights Republican debate would be enough to bring the surging freshman Florida senator back to the pack in the race for second placeIn the twoperson Democratic race Sanders has held an advantage over Clinton in New Hampshire for weeks The state is friendly territory for the Vermont senator and a mustwin if hes to have a chance of staying competitive with Clinton as the race moves to more diverse states that are seen as more hospitable to the former secretary of stateChristie has been unrelenting in questioning Rubios readiness and authenticity At Saturdays debate he slammed the senator for repeatedly reciting antiObama talking points He repeated the criticism Monday night in an appearance on Fox News The Kelly FileYou cant repeat the same thing over and over again Christie said Is Rubio going to do that sitting across from Russian President Vladimir Putin Theres no substance thereHes a nice guy he has talent Christie continued But hes too youngtoo inexperienced and he has served not one day in a position of management in his entire lifeRubio though has dug in and continued to repeat his criticism of President Obama that drew Christies scornPeople said Oh you said the same thing three or four times Im going to say it again Rubio said Monday in LondonderryAs far as that message I hope they keep running it And Im going to keep saying it because its true Rubio said Sunday on ABCs This Week Barack Obama  said he wanted to change the country Hes doing it in a way that is robbing us of everything that is specialSpeaking on Fox News Bush said hes also going to continue taking on frontrunner Trump as he did during Saturdays debateHes not a conservative he doesnt have the temperament to be president and whenever I have the chance to describe what I think about him Im gonna do it Bush said MondayBush hammered Trump on Saturday for his broad support of eminent domain  and Trumps past attempt to use it to take a womans property for a project in Atlantic City During that dispute Trump tried to shush Bush but was booed by the audienceBush pointed to that exchange in questioning how Trump would do in a general election raceYou think hes gonna shush Hillary Clinton Bush said He would loseTrump saved his harshest attacks Monday for Bush as well as Cruz who bested him in IowaWhen an audience member at a rally in Manchester shouted out an insult directed at Cruz  a vulgar term for coward  Trump repeated the term and jokingly reprimanded the womanCruz spokesman Rick Tyler responded to the Associated Press via email saying Lets not forget who whipped who in IowaJeb is having some kind of a breakdown I think Trump told CNN Monday calling Bush the son and brother of presidents a spoiled child and an embarrassment to his family I think its a very sad situation thats taking placeKasich meanwhile has taken a less confrontational approach in the race casting himself as a uniting force and touting his economic record as governor The Ohio governor has seemingly pinned his hopes on New Hampshire and said Sunday hes going in strong  while stressing he also has substantial resources on the ground in states like South Carolina and NevadaKasich also criticized Bush over an online video that hit Kasich for expanding Medicaid and what the Bush campaign called his liberal record in Ohio compared to Bushs two terms as Florida governorIm really disappointed in Jeb Kasich told The Kelly File Look I mean hes taken the very low road to the highest office in the land and hes been negative all along but thats okayCarson and Fiorina also are looking to do better than they did in Iowa but have struggled to even break into the middle tier in Granite State pollingThe
