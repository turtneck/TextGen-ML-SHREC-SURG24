Posted on November 3 2016 by Charles Hugh Smith Lets set aside Hillary Clinton as an individual and consider her as the perfection of a corrupt political system As I noted yesterday Politics As Usual Is Dead  and Hillary Clinton is the ultimate product of the political system that is disintegrating before our eyes The corruption of paytoplay and the commingling of public and private influence is not the failing of an individualit is the logical conclusion of a thoroughly corrupt political system Given the incentives built into politics as usual  publicprivate paytoplay doesnt just make senseit is the only possible maximization of the political system  Cobble together a multimillion dollar private foundation millions of dollars in speaking fees from bigmoney contributors conflicts of interest the secrecy of private email servers paytoplay schemes and corrupted loyalists planted in the Department of Justice and the inevitable result is a politics as usual moneyharvesting machine that lays waste to the nation supporters and critics alike All the Clintons did is assemble the parts more effectively than anyone else Now that the machine has scooped up hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions and other loot vested interests and corrupted loyalists within the federal government will do anything to protect the machine and its vast flow of funds The nations political system needs a thorough cleaning from top to bottom Exposing the Clintons perfection of politics as usual wont change the conditions and incentives that created the Clintons harvester of corruption That will require rooting out the incentives that made the Clintons perfection of corruption both logical and inevitable
