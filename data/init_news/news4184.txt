Washington CNN The stakes of Bernie Sanders takeittotheconvention strategy are rapidly rising as fresh polls underscore Hillary Clintons vulnerabilities and predict a tight race between her and Donald Trump in the fallAfter months of talk about the potential of a contested Republican convention Trump the presumptive GOP nominee is quickly consolidating his partys support  something Clinton is unable to do with Sanders still in the raceWith only a few major nominating contests left including California and New Jersey on June 7 Sanders lacks a credible mathematical path to overhauling Clintons wide lead in pledged delegates And with polls showing Clintons general election advantage over Trump evaporating a lingering fracture in the Democratic party could be perilous for its chances to keep the White HouseStill Sanders is not heeding calls from some Democrats to get out of the race  or at least cool his rhetoric during the final weeks of the primary season Instead he kept up his blistering criticism of Clinton over the weekend and deepened his feud with the party establishment including endorsing the primary challenger to Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman SchultzThe last I heard is that we are a democratic country and that elections are about vigorous debates over the issues Secretary Clinton and I disagree Sanders told Jake Tapper Sunday on CNNs State of the Union What the Democratic leadership has got to understand is that not all of my supporters go to these fancy fundraising dinners Theyre working people who are hurting now who want real change in the economyHe added I hope the Democratic leadership understands they have to open up the process bring those people inSanders acknowledged in the interview that he has a very very uphill fight in his quest to overtake Clinton given that he has won 46 of pledged delegates so far and she has won 54 But he rebuked Democratic superdelegates  party office holders and lawmakers who can vote however they choose at the convention  for overwhelmingly coming out for Clinton early on in what he said was an anointment by the establishment and big money interestsClintons failure to finally put away the Sanders campaign is grating on the former secretary of stateI will be the nominee for my party Clinton told CNNs Chris Cuomo in an interview last week That is already done in effect There is no way I wont beOn Sunday she said there will be an obvious need of us to unify the party once she becomes the presumptive nomineeI will certainly do my part reaching out to Sen Sanders reaching out to his supporters she said on NBCs Meet the Press And I expect him to do hisThe internal conflict comes at a time when polls show that Trump is getting a dividend from closing out the Republican primary race and setting up what could be a close election against Clinton in NovemberA Fox News poll last week showed Trump leading Clinton 45 to 42 findings that were within the surveys margin of error Meanwhile a New York TimesCBS News national survey released Thursday had Clinton up by six pointsQuinnipiac University polls in swing states Ohio Florida and Pennsylvania this month also had the rivals effectively neckandneckPolls this far out from a general election cannot offer a reliable picture of what will happen in November But they can shape the political environment in which the early stages of the race evolves and if they continue to show Trump gaining in strength are likely to increase pressure on Sanders to bring the Democratic Party togetherBut Sanders does not see such polls as an argument that he should get out of the race or dial back attacks on Clinton In fact he sees them as proof that he would be a superior general election candidate to the former first lady  most polls show him leading TrumpIn the NBC interview Clinton suggested Sanders simply hasnt been subjected to the rough and tumble of politics the way she hasIts fair to say that I have been vetted and tested and I think that that puts me in a very strong position she saidReferring to Sanders she said let me say that I dont think hes had a single negative ad ever run against himSanders disputed the notion that he is only doing better than Clinton because he has not had to endure the years of partisan warfare that have shredded her approval ratingsAny objective assessment of our campaign versus Clintons campaign I think will conclude we have the energy we have the excitement we have the young people we have the working people we can drive a large voter turnout so that we not only win the White House but we retain regain control of the Senate do well in the House and in governors chairs up and down the line Sanders told TapperLatest polls clearly show that the lingering Democratic Party divisions are a challenge for ClintonThe Washington PostABC poll released Sunday showed that in a matchup equation with Trump Clinton currently gets 86 of Democratic voters meaning that a slice of the party coalition that is not yet sold on her as nomineeMaking a decision to leave a primary race or to tone down attacks on a rival who appears headed for victory is the toughest choices any candidate faces It is a particularly acute dilemma for Sanders given that he has won millions of votes ignited a populist uprising in the Democratic Party that no one saw coming and is basking in an unprecedented reception to his democratic socialist ideas that left him in the political wilderness for years in the SenateHe and his campaign team have dismissed the idea that he could wreak lasting damage on Clinton if she becomes the nominee saying he will do whatever it takes to ensure that Trump does not win the presidency But if his arguments about the process of the Democratic primary race leave the impression that he has been unfairly treated and that Clinton is somehow not the legitimate nominee the task of uniting the party becomes far more difficultThats where Sanders clash with Wasserman Schultz is particularly concerning to some Democrats The Vermont senators campaign has consistently accused the DNC chairwoman of tilting the race in favor of Clinton and criticized the scheduling of debates on Saturday nights when television audiences are lower and the closed primaries that bar independents in big states like New YorkSanders is now backing Wasserman Schultzs primary opponent in her Florida district Tim Canova and left no doubt about the strengths of his feelings about her on SundayWell clearly I favor her opponent Sanders told Tapper His views are much closer to mine than as to Wasserman Schultzs In all due respect to the current chairperson If I was elected president she would not be reappointed to be chair of the DNCSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver also sent out a fundraising email to supporters Sunday seeking contributions for CanovaFor all the sudden handwringing in Democratic circles its still likely that Clinton will enjoy her own boost in the polls once she finally becomes the presumptive Democratic nominee similar to the one Trump is enjoying nowFor now veteran Democrats appear to be ready to give Sanders some room But the clock is tickingAfter Clinton has actually won after she actually has enough delegates to win the nomination I think Bernie needs to think about his legacy said Mark Alderman a top Democratic Party donor who was part of President Barack Obamas transition team Bernie is in the middle of the tsunami  he doesnt have any perspective yet It will take a little time Unfortunately he only has a little time He has got to get it together by July
