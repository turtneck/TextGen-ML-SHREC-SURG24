Iranian negotiators reportedly have made a lastditch push for more concessions from the US and five other world powers as talks on the fate of Irans nuclear program come down to the final days before a crucial deadlineThe New York Times reported late Sunday that Tehran had backed away from a tentative promise to ship a large portion of its uranium stockpile to Russia where it could not be used as part of any future weapons program Western officials insisted to the paper that the uranium did not have to be sent overseas but could be disposed of in other waysThe new twist in the talks comes just two days before the deadline for both sides to agree on a framework for a permanent deal The final deadline for a permanent deal would not arrive until the end of JuneHowever if Iran insists on keeping its uranium in the country it would undermine a key argument made in favor of the deal by the Obama administration The Times reports that if the uranium had gone to Russia it would have been converted into fuel rods which are difficult to use in nuclear weapons It is not clear what would happen to the uranium if it remained in IranThe Associated Press reported Sunday that Irans position had shifted from from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10000 centrifuges enriching uranium to agreeing to keep 6000 Western officials involved in the talks told the Associated Press that Tehran may be ready to accept an even lower numberThe United States and its allies want a deal that extends the time Iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year However The Times reported Sunday that a paper published by Olli Heinonen former head of inspections for the UNs nuclear watchdog estimated that Iran could still develop a nuclear weapon in seven or eight months with around 6500 centrifugesTehran says it wants to enrich uranium only for energy science industry and medicine But many countries fear Iran could use the technology to make weaponsgrade uraniumOfficials told the Associated Press that another main dispute involved the length of an agreement Iran they said wants a total lifting of all caps on its activities after 10 years while the US and the five other nations at the talks  Russia China Britain France and Germany  insist on progressive removal after a decadeA senior US official characterized the issue as lack of agreement on what happens in years 11 to 15 The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with State Department rules on briefing about the closeddoor talksLimits on Irans research and development of centrifuges also were unresolved the Western officials saidTehran has created a prototype centrifuge that it says enriches uranium 16 times faster than its present mainstay model The US and its partners want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of making enough weaponsgrade uranium for a bomb once limits on Irans programs are liftedOne official said Russia opposed the US position that any UN penalties lifted in the course of a deal should be reimposed quickly if Tehran reneged on any commitmentsBoth Western officials said Iran was resisting attempts to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possibleThere was tentative agreement on turning a nearlyfinished reactor into a model that gives off less plutonium waste than originally envisaged Plutonium like enriched uranium is a path to nuclear weaponsIran and the US were discussing letting Iran run centrifuges at an underground bunker that has been used to enrich uranium The machines would produce isotopes for peaceful applications the officials saidWith the Tuesday deadline approaching and problems remaining US Secretary of State John Kerry canceled plans Sunday to return to the United States for an event honoring the late US Sen Edward Kennedy French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and FrankWalter Steinmeier his German counterpart scratched planned trips to KazakhstanKerry has been in discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif since ThursdayThe Associated Press contributed to this reportClick for more from The New York Times
