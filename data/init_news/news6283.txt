I hasten to underscore that I vigorously disagree with Graham on a wide range of issues especially his interventionist posture on Iraq and the broader Middle East Although from what Ive witnessed especially throughout the Republican nominating process Graham has comported himself at least as a man of integrity Not for nothing but he appears on the surface to be a nice enough guy at least compared with his GOP colleagues who mostly drive oneto violent profanitystrewn outburstsThis weeks big story is the saga of a Rowan County KY clerk Kim Davis who was jailed indefinitely Thursday by US District Judge David Bunning for refusing to issue marriage licenses to samesex couples in compliance with an earlier court order Davis will remain in federal custody until she agrees to issue the appropriate licenses Last month meanwhile a Texas clerk named Katie Lang was hit with a court settlement to the tune of 44000 in damages and legal fees for refusing to issue a license for a gay couple But it clearly wasnt punitive enough to scare Davis whos clearly acting in contempt of Judge Bunnings orderDavis believes that by issuing the licenses shell be condemned to Hell Of course her perceived biblical trespass is ridiculously cherrypicked as it always is Homophobes like Davis seem to only zeroin on Leviticus and a few letters written by the apostle Paul Regarding the latter and briefly put Paul was merely recruiting pagan gentiles to the ascetic Christian lifestyle Paganism often included sex acts in temple rituals so naturally converts would have to reject those old forms of worship Paul by the way in Romans also expressly forbid debating boasting deception being unmerciful and winedrinking Thatd be a quintuple Hellworthy condemnation for John Boehner Its also worth noting that the terms homosexuality and samesex marriage were anachronistic in the ancient world making it impossible for the Bible to explicitly condemn eitherIncidentally its come to light that Davis has been divorced three times and married four So much for the sanctity of marriage And in the various video clips and photos of Davis shes clearly wearing two types of cloth at the same time which is a direct violation of Gods decree in Leviticus 1919The bottom line here is that Davis works in the public sector and therefore is forbidden by the establishment clause of the First Amendment from imposing her blindingly contradictory faith on the public Naturally shes also acting in defiance of the Supreme Courts decision in Obergefell v Hodges My cynical side tells me theres more to Davis motives Shes already been lionized by the bigoted farright with at least two GOP presidential candidates rushing to her support so its not unfair to speculate that shes gripped by the lure of national attentionTo wit Mike Huckabee personally called Davis to offer his encouragement and naturally his prayers Meanwhile Rand Paul said that Davis actions are indicative of the American way Paul went on to sayI think one way to get around the whole idea of what the Supreme Court is forcing on the states is for states just to get out of the business of giving out licenses Paul said Alabama has already voted to do this theyre just no longer going to give out licenses And anybody can make a contract And then if you want a marriage contract you go to a church And so Ive often said we could have gotten around all of this also in the sense that I do believe everybody has a right to a contract This is bizarre given how Paul is one of the most vocal supporters of states rights  letting the states take control of nearly everything Then again hes such a notorious flipflopper that he makes Mitt Romney look like a steadfast pillar of unwavering integrity Speaking of which lets return to integrity A third presidential candidate Lindsey Graham also weighed in on the Davis story but not in the way youd expect from a conservative Republican It turns out Graham said exactly what any sane rational human being might say As a public official comply with the law or resign Graham told clerk Kim Davis  The rule of law is the rule of law Graham said We are a rule of law nation And I appreciate her conviction and I support traditional marriage but shes accepted a job where she has to apply the law to everyone and thats her choice Okay that was precisely the correct reaction to the story Except of course the thing about supporting traditional marriage but nobodys perfect Whats more noteworthy however is that Graham said this in total defiance of both his party and his congressional delegation each of which routinely scrambles over itself to pander as much if not more to antigay Americans as it does to racists and sexists Additionally Graham had the guts to say it to one of the topshelf nationally syndicated conservative radio hosts Hugh Hewitt The liberal equivalent mightve been for example Elizabeth Warren hypothetically defending the NRA on Real Time with Bill Maher No wonder Graham is losing badly in a GOP presidential field populated by goofballs racists and overpaid comment trolls While hes not going to win any popularity polls on the left there are two things any liberal ought to be able to say about Graham 1 He obviously possesses at least amodicumof integrity thats unmatched by the majority of his colleagues and 2 he appears to be one of the few remaining national politicians who at least in the here and now hasnt sold out to the inchoate screeching and personality politics of the Tea Party and Fox News ChannelAnd thats a real accomplishment given the strong incentives in the other direction In the blurting culture of Trumpera politics we need more leaders like Graham who are willing to take the rational highroad rather than dutifully falling in line with the fireeaters extremists and carnival geeks of his party
