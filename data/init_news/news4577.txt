Hillary Clintons ties to large corporations have come under more scrutiny after it was revealed that dozens of companies that have donated millions to her familys foundation also lobbied the State Department during her tenure as secretary of stateThe Wall Street Journal reports that the 60 companies who lobbied Clintons State Department between 2009 and 2013 donated over 26 million to the Clinton Foundation in that period The donors include instantly recognizable names like General Electric Exxon Mobil and BoeingThe Journal also reports that at least 44 of the 60 companies participated in philanthropy projects valued at 32 billion set up by the Clinton Global Initiative which is a wing of the foundation At least 25 of the companies also contributed to 15 publicprivate partnerships created by Clinton and coordinated by the State DepartmentWhile there is no evidence that any laws were broken the connections do raise potentially thorny ethical questions as Clinton prepares for a likely 2016 run for the Democratic presidential nominationClinton spokesman Nick Merrill told the Journal that she did the job that every secretary of state is supposed to do and what the American people expect of themespecially during difficult economic times She proudly and loudly advocated on behalf of American business and took every opportunity she could to promote US commercial interests abroadThe latest report comes on the heels of the disclosure that donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation have increased considerably following the removal of a selfimposed ban on such contributions during Hillarys time as Secretary of State Experts have said that the donation ban should be immediately reimposed until Clinton formally decides one way or another whether she will seek the White House On Thursday the foundation said it would consider whether to accept such contributions should Clinton decide to run but would not commit to rejecting such donations in the futureThe Journal report cites several examples of Clinton promoting eventual donors to the Foundation and its various activities For example in October 2012 she lobbied the Algerian government to contract General Electric to build power plants in that country The following month the Foundation approached the company about expanding a healthaccess initiative An eventual partnership was formed to which the company contributed between 500000 and 1 million The Algerian government awarded GE the power plant contract in September 2013Other efforts were less successful In 2010 Clinton announced cooperation between the US and Poland on a scheme to develop shale gas deposits in eastern Europe After several years of false starts Exxon Mobil and Chevron gave up their Polish plansIn 2012 Clinton persuaded Bulgarias government to issue a fiveyear license to Chevron allowing conventional gas exploration That too went nowhere The following year the Journal reports Chevron donated 250000 to the foundationExxon Mobil for its part has donated at least 188 million to various initiatives including a nonprofit womens group called vital voicesIn at least one case a sizable corporate monetary promise was made before a Clinton overseas trip In 2012 WalMart a company with whom the Clintons have ties going back to their days in Arkansas pledged 12 million to various causes supporting woman in Latin America 15 million of that money went toward a Clinton Foundation publicprivate partnership and another 500000 went to Vital VoicesA month later Clinton lobbied the Indian government to reverse a ban on multibrand retailers opening up a potentially lucrative market for several US companies including WalMart The effort was unsuccessfulClick for more from The Wall Street Journal
