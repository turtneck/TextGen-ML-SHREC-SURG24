Share on Facebook When you imagine partisan government overreach its hard not to think about the Bush administration especially when it comes to ignoring the law to accomplish their goals think enhanced interrogation When they tell the FBI theyve gone too far well the FBI had better listen In an OpEd in the New York Times  Richard Painter George W Bushs White House ethics lawyer from 2005  2007 wrote about his problems with the FBIs latest investigation of Hillary Clinton and most surprisingly hes taking legal action to stop it According to Painter its an abuse of power It would be highly improper and an abuse of power for the FBI to conduct such an investigation in the public eye particularly on the eve of the election It would be an abuse of power for the director of the FBI absent compelling circumstances to notify members of Congress from the party opposing the candidate that the candidate or his associates were under investigation It would be an abuse of power if FBI agents went so far as to obtain a search warrant and raid the candidates office tower hauling out boxes of documents and computers in front of television cameras The FBIs job is to investigate not to influence the outcome of an election Beyond that Painter says its against the law the Hatch Act in particular to try to influence the outcome of an election On that basis Painter is taking action George W Bushs ethics lawyer filed a complaint yesterday against the FBI for violations of the Hatch Act Via NYT httpstcocXbs2xFYxj pictwittercom3FbVRCPTyi  Nick Gourevitch nickgourevitch October 30 2016 And that is why on Saturday I filed a complaint against the FBI with the Office of Special Counsel which investigates Hatch Act violations and with the Office of Government Ethics I have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers ethics including two and a half years as the chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W Bush and I never thought that the FBI could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations Until this week The Hatch Act specifically prohibits government officials with the exception of the President the Vice President and a handful of others from engaging in political activities Painter is particularly concerned about the fact that FBI director James Comey has made comments about Hillary Clinton in the past such as his statement that Clintons handling of classified information was extremely careless What seems extremely careless is the way Comey has handled this investigation On Friday the director of the FBI James B Comey sent to members of Congress a letter updating them on developments in the agencys investigation of Mrs Clintons emails an investigation which supposedly was closed months ago This letter which was quickly posted on the internet made highly unusual public statements about an FBI investigation concerning a candidate in the election The letter was sent in violation of a longstanding Justice Department policy of not discussing specifics about pending investigations with others including members of Congress According to some news reports on Saturday the letter was sent before the FBI had even obtained the search warrant that it needed to look at the newly discovered emails And it was sent days before the election at a time when many Americans are already voting Painter notes that Comeys intent doesnt matter He violated the rules simply by taking the actions that could influence the election and frankly there was no reason for Comey to release those emails which arent even directly tied to Clinton now He finished his oped with a dire warning to Americans This is no trivial matter We cannot allow FBI or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway That is an abuse of power Allowing such a precedent to stand will invite more and even worse abuses of power in the future Painter isnt alone in sharing this concern about Comey Before these latest emails Politico published an oped comparing Comey to the notorious J Edgar Hoover  who was the first FBI director who was perhaps best known for using questionable tactics to bring down dissidents Since taking office Comey has repeatedly injected his views into executive branch deliberations on issues such as sentencing reform and the roots of violence against police officers He has undermined key presidential priorities such as crafting a coherent federal policy on cybersecurity and encryption Most recently he shattered longstanding precedent by publicly offering his own conclusions about the FBIs investigation into Hillary Clintons email The FBI did not respond to a request for comment It would be difficult to arguein terms of temperament manner or motivationthat he is or ever will be the next J Edgar Hoover But increasing numbers of critics believe he has displayed a worrying disregard for the rules and norms that have constrained all but one of his predecessors straying with blithe confidenceand with increasing regularityacross the fine line that separates independence from unaccountability If nothing else this election year has shown us something completely unprecedented and completely undemocratic Its not just that Comey is influencing the election hes using emails stolen by a foreign government to influence an election As Donald Trump says this is  worse than Watergate  just not in the way Trump thinks
