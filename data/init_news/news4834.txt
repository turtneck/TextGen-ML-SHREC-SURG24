 Donald Trump Likely to End Aid for Rebels Fighting Syrian GovernmentBy DAVID E SANGER November 13  NYT   WASHINGTON  Presidentelect Donald J Trump said Friday that he was likely to abandon the American effort to support moderate opposition groups in Syria who are battling the government of President Bashar alAssad saying we have no idea who these people areIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal that dealt largely with economic issues including his willingness to retain parts of the Affordable Care Act he repeated a position he took often during his campaign that the United States should focus on defeating the Islamic State and find common ground with the Syrians and their Russian backersIve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria Mr Trump told The Journal My attitude was youre fighting Syria Syria is fighting ISIS and you have to get rid of ISIS Russia is now totally aligned with Syria and now you have Iran which is becoming powerful because of us is aligned with SyriaHis comments suggest that once Mr Trump begins overseeing both the public support for the opposition groups and a far larger covert effort run by the Central Intelligence Agency he may wind down or abandon the effort But there are in fact two wars going on simultaneously in SyriaOne is against the Islamic State in which the United States is supporting 30000 SyrianKurdish and SyrianArab fighters who last weekend announced they were opening a new phase of the battle beginning to encircle the ISIS capital in Raqqa There are roughly 300 United States Special Operations forces on the ground assisting these militiaThe second effort is in support of rebels fighting Mr Assad The CIA covert program is by far the largest conduit of support providing antitank missiles to rebels fighting the government That is the program that Mr Trump seems most intent on ending If the United States pursues that line We end up fighting Russia fighting Syria Mr Trump told The JournalThe argument for ending the support may be bolstered by the fact that as a matter of survival those opposition groups have entered into battlefield alliances with the affiliate of Al Qaeda in Syria formerly known as Al Nusra This has had the effect of allowing Mr Assad and Russia to argue that they are attacking Al Qaeda and the United States should aid them in that effort Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that argument during his ultimately failed effort to reach a deal for a ceasefire and an ultimate settlementMr Trumps theenemyofmyenemyismyfriend logic is consistent with what he said during the campaign Im not saying Assad is a good man cause hes not he told The New York Times in an interview in March but our far greater problem is not Assad its ISISBut it also takes a position that will gratify President Vladimir V Putin because it suggests that rather than pressure Russia to end its support of Mr Assad a Trump administration will get out of Mr Putins wayIn another hint of a major change in policy one of Mr Trumps primary national security advisers Lt General Michael T Flynn the retired head of the Defense Intelligence Agency wrote in The Hill newspaper this week that the United States should extradite Fethullah Gulen who Turkey has demanded should be sent back from his exile in Pennsylvania The Turkish government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has blamed him for a coup attempt over the summerThe Justice Department has not yet concluded that there is any convincing evidence that Mr Gulen should be sent back to almost certain confinement or execution under an extradition treaty with the United States They see the request as part of Mr Erdogans effort to eliminate all oppositionMr Flynn adopted many of Turkeys arguments about Mr Gulen arguing that American taxpayers are helping finance Gulens 160 charter schools in the United States and that it is more important to support Turkey than be hoodwinked by this masked source of terror and instability nestled comfortably in our own backyardEric Schmitt contributed reporting President Assad Syria is ready to cooperate with Donald Trump  The US is currently enmeshed in a complicated alliance in Syria with Turkey and Saudi Arabia who would like to provide rebels  among them alQaedabacked factions  with surfacetoair missiles What will Trump do on Syria The US should get out of the war in Syria and avoid destabilising more Middle Eastern countries and the US should work with Putin to defeat terrorist groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ISIL also known as ISIS
