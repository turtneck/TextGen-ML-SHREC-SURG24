BREAKING Obama ATF Accused of Covering Up Political Element in Firebombing of GOP HQ I am not of the mindset that any vote not for Trump is a vote for Hillary but a vote for Trump is a vote against Hillary And I need to vote against Hillary I need to vote against the media Hunter noted the extreme bias exhibited by the media who refused to factcheck Clinton at the last debate and what he sees as the difference between what a Trump and a Clinton presidency would look like A Trump administration at least will include people I trust in positions that matter I dont know if they will be able to hold him completely in check but I know a Clinton administration will include people who have been her coconspirators in corruption and there wont even be a media to hold her accountable   Although Hunter didnt want to tell NeverTrumpers how they should vote he asked them to think about how important it is to keep Clinton out of office Im not saying you should support him but you shouldnt lose sight of the importance of opposing her If or when Hillary Clinton takes the oath of office she needs to have as little support as possible Frankly she needs to be damaged The mainstream media wont do it theyre in on it A simple protest vote for a third party or a writein of my favorite comic book character might feel good for a moment It might even give me a sense of moral superiority that lasts until her first executive order damaging something I hold dear  or her first Supreme Court nominee But the sting that will follow will far outlive that temporary satisfaction  I oppose much of what Donald Trump has said but I oppose everything Hillary Clinton has done and wants to do And what someone says no matter how objectionable is less important than what someone does especially when its so objectionable A personal moral victory wont suffice when the stakes are so high As such I am compelled to vote against Hillary by voting for the only candidate with any chance whatsoever of beating her  Donald Trump
