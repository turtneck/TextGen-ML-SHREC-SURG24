Washington CNN As Vice President Joe Biden continues to contemplate a late entry into the race for the Democratic presidential nomination he faces obstacles toward arriving at yes  not least of which is his own emotional state three months after his sons deathAfter a week of meetings with key Democrats  including influential Sen Elizabeth Warren and labor leader Richard Trumka president of the AFLCIO  Biden on Friday didnt appear any closer to making a decision which advisers still expect is weeks awayHell have more chances to consult members of his party next week when he heads south to rally support behind the administrations nuclear deal with Iran Rep Debbie Wasserman Schultz the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee invited Biden to make the case for the agreement in person in south Florida on ThursdayThe DNC has kept Biden and his political team abreast of debate schedules heading into the fall and most Democratic operatives say the vice president must decide by the first forum  a CNNsponsored event on Oct 13  whether or not hes runningBiden still faces the daunting proposition of raising enough campaign cash to compete with the tens of millions already collected by Hillary Clinton and carving out support among key Democratic voting blocs to make a dent in her frontrunner statusBut weighing heaviest friends say is the grueling toll a third presidential campaign could exact on his familyHe told a conference call of Democrats this week that he was still in the process of determining whether or not there is the emotional fuel at this time to run just months after his eldest son Beau Biden lost his battle with brain cancerAssociates say the vice presidents son Hunter supports a bid and Beau encouraged his father to join the race before he died But having weathered two previous presidential bids the Biden family is intimately familiar with the withering pace and barbed attacks that would come with becoming a candidate againHis wife Dr Jill Biden is said to be apprehensive about joining another run for president as her family continues to grieveIve given this a lot of thought and dealing internally with the family on how we do this Biden told Democrats on the conference call this week as first reported by CNNThe calculus for this has been evaluating his personal feelings having just come off Beaus passing said James Smith a South Carolina state legislator whos a supporter of BidensDeciding whether to run for president has little to do with a calculation of his own ambitions Smith saidA Quinnipiac survey this week showed Biden faring well against potential Republican challengers in potential general election matchups against Donald Trump and Jeb Bush he performs better than Clinton His favorability rating was higher than any candidate actually running for the Democratic nomination And even though he has yet to declare his intentions hes still running ahead of former Maryland Gov Martin OMalley former Rhode Island Gov Lincoln Chaffee or former Virginia Sen Jim WebbBut even those numbers may not be enough to convince Biden that jumping into the race is worth it Politicians merely contemplating a bid  and not yet subject to the attacks of their rivals or scrutiny from opposition researchers  often poll better than when they become fullblown candidatesCase in point Clinton whose favorability stood near 60 last fall as she contemplated a run but had dropped to 44 in the latest CNNORC survey taken in midAugustClintons campaign this week attempted to flex its organizing muscle by unveiling endorsements in key early voting states including from former Iowa Gov Tom Vilsack currently serving alongside Biden in the Obama administration as agriculture secretaryVilsack was the first cabinet secretary to declare an allegiance in the Democratic primary though other key figures within the Clinton orbit were also signaling wariness about a Biden runRunning for office is one thing You have to also have the energy for that process said Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel who served as Obamas first chief of staff and supports Clinton in the primary You also have to have the energy for the jobFormer Iowa Sen Tom Harkin another Clinton supporter told The New York Times this week that Biden has served the country so well but that making a run for president I just dont think  would be a wise moveClinton speaking at the summer meeting of Democrats in Minnesota said she wanted to give Biden the space and time to make up his mindI have the greatest affection and admiration for the vice president she said during a press conference in Minneapolis This is a difficult decision for him to makeAs she spoke members of the Draft Biden group were eagerly making the case for a Biden candidacy to Democratic Party members and socalled superdelegatesTheir pitch that its too early to anoint a frontrunner in the Democratic race and that influential party members should remain openminded about selecting a candidate to supportWhile the vice president is working through his process on whether or not he actually wants to run for president  we continue to make the public case for why we think hes the best candidate for our party to put up for the presidency said Steve Schale an adviser to the groupA key mission developing a campaign infrastructure in early voting states Biden could utilize if he decides to jump inGoing to be up to the American peopleFor Biden the decision on entering the race risks dividing loyalists to President Barack Obama who has repeatedly praised Bidens work as vice president while also proclaiming Clinton an exemplary secretary of stateSome White House aides have expressed concern a Biden bid  at this point still a longshot against Clinton  could end poorly damaging the vice presidents political legacyObama discussed the potential of Biden joining the race during a regularly scheduled lunch with the vice president Monday and hasnt dissuaded the vice president from running as hes publicly weighed a run over the past several monthsAsked this week about potentially having to decide between his vice president and his former top diplomat Obama offered his typical demurralJoe and Hillary are wonderful people and great friends he told CNN Philadelphia affiliate WPVI during an interview at the White House Wednesday Joes been as good a vice president as I think weve seen in American history Been at my side on every tough decision Ive ever madeClinton meanwhile was one of our best secretaries of state and helped work on a whole range of important issues Obama said The truth is though the great thing about American democracy is its not up to me Im just one voter Its going to be up to the American peopleThe White House says Obama will indeed vote in the Illinois Democratic primary next year and hasnt ruled out a presidential endorsement in the race
