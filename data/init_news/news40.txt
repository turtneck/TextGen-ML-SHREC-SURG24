Presidential hopefuls in both parties agree on at least one thing Economic mobility and the feeling of many Americans that they are being shut out from the nations prosperity will be a defining theme of the 2016 campaignFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush last week became the latest Republican to signal a readiness to engage Democrats on what historically has been their turf putting issues of middleclass wage stagnation poverty and shared prosperity at the forefront of their political messagesBushs framing of the economic and social challenges facing the country nearly mirrors that of likely Democratic candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton as well as other possible contenders on the left Sen Marco Rubio RFla has written a book on the subject American Dreams Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone to be published this week while Sen Rand Paul RKy has proposed policies for distressed communities that he sees as the ticket to the middle classAnd Mitt Romney the 2012 GOP nominee who was portrayed by Democrats as insensitive to and out of touch with the lives of middle and workingclass Americans has told friends he considers poverty a topic du jour as he weighs another run in 2016You talk to any pollster on the Democratic side or the Republican side theyre in complete agreement on the idea that there has to be an economic populist message said Matthew Dowd a top strategist for former president George W Bushs 2000 and 2004 campaigns Then it comes down to Are there credible solutions and is there a credible candidateAbout 45million Americans live at or below the poverty line according to last falls census estimates while the median household income in the United States in 2013 was just under 52000 Adjusted for inflation the median is 8percent lower than it was in 2007 the last full year before the recession and 11percent below what it was in 2000Wage stagnation has been a persistent problem for low and middleincome workers Since the late 1970s wages for the bottom 70percent of earners have been essentially stagnant and between 2009 and 2013 real wages fell for the entire bottom 90 percent of the wage distribution Lawrence Mishel of the liberal Economic Policy Institute wrote in a paper published this monthLaunching his new political action committee Right to Rise Jeb Bush asserted last week in the PACs mission statement that President Obamas tenure has been pretty good for those at the top of the income scale but a lost decade for everyone elseMillions of our fellow citizens across the broad middle class feel as if the American Dream is now out of their reach that our politics are petty and broken that opportunities are elusive and that the playing field is no longer fair or level Bush wrote Too many of the poor have lost hope that a path to a better life is within their graspBushs focus adds an unexpected element to the coming debate and puts pressure on the entire field himself included to come forward with fresh policies that address the nations core economic problemsThe shift also highlights a potential vulnerability for Democrats In his campaigns Obama twice promised to focus on wealth inequality and middleclass stagnation but those problems persist even as the economy revs up and unemployment fallsClinton could be challenged now from both the right and the left to lay out solutions that go beyond Obamas  and also to develop a political voice of her own to articulate them Democrats conceded after last falls midterm elections that they had not found a compelling economic messageDemocrats will look to Clinton should she run to take the lead in doing that  although they also are looking to Sen Elizabeth Warren DMass and her harderedged populist rhetoricClinton tested such a message last year In a major speech at the New America Foundation in May she said that Americans are finding it harder than ever to get their footing in our changing economy The dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reachThe language of Bush Rubio and other Republicans appears aimed at avoiding the problem that bedeviled Romney throughout his 2012 campaign The former Massachusetts governors memorable comment about the 47 percent of the population who he said depend on government and feel like victims haunted him during the final months before the electionYuval Levin editor of the conservative journal National Affairs said the overall shift in emphasis by Republicans is an effort to move away from Romneys more abstract message of job growth and to focus more specifically on social mobility and solutions for those at or near the bottomIts a process of letting the light out from under the bushel Levin said Citing past conservative leadership in reforming welfare he added I think Republican ideas have always held this promise but conservatives have not always emphasized these elements  A difference in emphasis is not insignificantDemocrats however argue that revising their rhetoric will not be enough for Republicans  especially if Jeb Bush becomes the GOP nominee  to gloss over former president George W Bushs legacy which Democrats say tightened the middleclass squeezeIts not like the Republican Party has clean hands on the issue of rising inequality said Neera Tanden president of the Center for American Progress and an adviser to Clinton on economic policy Its a weird thing to say I care about how the rest of the country is doing not just the top earners when your brother cut taxes for the wealthy and your partys economic position starts with undoing DoddFrank the 2010 law that tightened regulation of Wall StreetObama hit the road last week to highlight economic successes of his presidency from the auto industry bailout to more robust overall growth in the last half of 2014 Still many Democrats acknowledge that there is a large gap between promise and results on issues of middleclass insecuritiesThat is where Bush and some other Republicans are taking aim Two factors have contributed to the opening they seeOne is the continued problem of stagnating wages for the broad middle class and the income gap between rich and nonrich The other is new evidence that it has become harder for those at the bottom to rise into the middle class and that the risk of some born into the middle class  particularly minorities  falling out of it is growingDemocrats long have been seen as the party more trusted to deal with middleclass economic issues Republicans long have resisted policies that smack of economic redistribution Could that be changingHow do you tell the middle class Were your guy said Grover Norquist a conservative antitax advocate Republicans feel comfortable saying that now because they feel the guys theyre running against are sufficiently discreditedWilliam Galston of the Brookings Institution said that the issue of blocked social mobility is one Republicans will feel more comfortable engaging  and on their own terms Thats what Jeb Bush is saying We can accept a definition of a problem  but give unabashedly conservative responses to those challenges he saidBut Galston a former domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton said Bushs framing of the issue this way means he has put down a marker that he will be expected to meetI would expect to hear from him over the coming months some of the best and most innovative conservative thinking on opportunity and upward mobility he said That will be a fair test on how much gas there is in the conservative ideas tankOther Republicans have been working to reorient their party toward bluecollar economics and to put forward fresh economic ideas Former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee two former presidential candidates who are looking at running in 2016 long have talked about the GOPs need to recognize the problems of working familiesHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan RWis has focused on policies designed to lift people out of poverty In 2012 as Romneys running mate Ryan wanted to campaign in inner cities and give speeches promoting individual empowerment He was frustrated that Romneys campaign team directed him to talk about other topicsRubio has proposed a fundamental shift in antipoverty programs He has suggested devolving power and responsibility from Washington to the states by consolidating federal monies into a flex fund The senator from Florida has called for significant reductions in federal regulations that he says will spur creation of better jobs On education he has offered a series of reforms designed to lessen the burden of student loan debt and expand access to apprenticeship programs Rubio and others also have proposed changes in the earnedincome tax credit to extend its reach to more peopleDemocrats are skeptical that Republicans can meet the challenge with policy proposals that are much beyond calls for tax cuts to spur economic growth and further efforts to scale back the size of governmentIt sounds to me like a traditional Romney Republican trickledown agenda but with a willingness to engage on inequality and mobility said Jared Bernstein a former adviser to Vice President Biden who works at the Center of Budget and Policy PrioritiesDemocrats say its too early to draw conclusions but they note that if Bush and other Republicans find new ways to engage middleclass voters with populist themes the pressures on Clinton will mount significantlyVoters are going to say Okay thank you for acknowledging this problem but what are you going to do about it Bernstein said I would argue that Democrats are going to have to have more in their toolbox than raising the minimum wage and universal preK
