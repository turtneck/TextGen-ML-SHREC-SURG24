The Senate voted Wednesday to clear the path to fund DHS after Republicans agreed to withdraw immigration restrictions from the bill But it will be tougher to get it through the House where member districts are more homogeneousNo question Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell R of Kentucky blinked when it came to funding the Department of Homeland SecurityWith the clock ticking toward a DHS shutdownFridaynight and Democrats repeatedly blocking debate on a funding bill because it contained immigration poison pills the Senate leader gave Democrats what they wantedon Wednesday a clean funding bill minus the toxic measure to block President Obamas executive immigration action on immigration in November That will be taken up separatelyWill House Speaker John Boehner R of Ohio also blink and bring the clean bill  expected to pass the Senate with a strong bipartisan vote  to the floor Such a move would put him at odds with many in his caucus and possibly prompt a challenge to his leadershipAs weeks of struggle over DHS funding have shown Republican control of both chambers doesnt necessarily mean smooth sailing for the GOP Even when the two leaders agree on policy  as they do in this case  they work under very different conditions with each chamber having its own political climate and ways of doing thingsMajority leader McConnell for instance faces the unique challenge of the filibuster  the Senate blocking device that requires 60 votes to overcome With Republicans holding 54 seats he needs at least six Democrats to pass any controversial legislation an incentive for at least a minimally bipartisan approachHe also has 24 senators up for reelection in 2016  several of them from blue states That encourages political flexibility Most GOP House seats on the other hand are secure in gerrymandered districts and red states That promotes rigidityMcConnell has his own challenge Having won a majority and a bigger one than he expected he still has a challenge in holding it And holding it means showing he can govern and providing some protection for senators who are up in Ohio in Pennsylvania in New Hampshire says Norman Ornstein a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in WashingtonHouse Republicanson the other hand dominate in states such as Mississippi Alabama Oklahoma Louisiana and Texas Mr Ornstein points out These individual House districts are themselves homogeneous echo chambersYou can hear the difference when talking with Republicans from these two worlds Republican Sen Mark Kirk is up for reelection in Illinois which Obama easily won in 2012 and 2008 He was an early supporter of a clean bill to fully fund DHS without the immigration riders He wanted nothing to come between his state and the fundingSenator Kirk recalls traveling through Chicagos OHare Airport which is a known potential terrorist target Boy did I get an earfulfrom the people I represent Senator Kirk says in a brief interview in the Senate basement on the way to his office Chicago doesnt work unless US military protects the United States We gotta have DHSKirk says hes tried to be the consistent lone voice in the wilderness on DHS funding and if our party doctrine was to mess the bill up then to say that the party doctrine was wrong and we should just pass clean DHSBut just a fiveminute walk away on the House side of the Capitol Rep John Fleming R of Louisiana holds the opposite view A tea party favorite he faced no Democratic opponent in his reelection bid of 2010 but he did face a Libertarian oneIn a scrum of reporters Congressman Fleming said a potential DHS shutdown did not come up at a closed GOP House conferenceWednesdaymorning The real question he continued is the presidents November executive action that would shield millions of undocumented immigrants from deportationThats executive overreach and unconstitutional he and other Republicans say In January the House GOP passed a DHS funding bill that also blocked funding for that programThe only tool we have in Congress to block an unconstitutional act that would severely damage Americans for generations to come is to deplete the funding of that very executive action and thats what our bill does and thats what we intend to do he saidWhen asked what his constituents think should be done about the funding issue he said We dont get a lot of calls because they know my position on this If I deviated theyd be very upsetIndeed conservatives such as Fleming would be very angry if Boehner decided to bring a clean DHS bill to the House floorMany have said they would not vote for a bill that did not also block the presidents immigration action and theyre supported by conservative bloggers and outside groups who are already screaming about a caveinSome House Republicans might even try to stage a leadership coup In January 25 Republicans voted for someone other than Boehner for speakerWhile McConnell faces his challenge of 60 votes the speakers challenge is to keep his diverse caucus in line so he can reach the magic target of 218 the number of votes needed to pass a bill in the HouseRepublicans hold 247 seats but with a diverse caucus its a challenge getting to 218 Boehner likens it to keeping frogs in a wheelbarrow and on controversial legislation  such as the budget  hes had to turn to Democrats for votesFor Boehner just as it has been for the last few years his challenge is how many times can he bring up things for passage that will require more Democrats and when he brings those up can he be sure hell get enough Republicans to add to the Democrats Ornstein saysIf DHS is to be fully funded a bill that kills the presidents executive action wont be part of it  that much has been made clear by the Senate showdown Boehner will either have to bring his caucus around or turn to House Democrats to buttress his numbers with a fallback position being a stopgap continuing resolutionI think Boehner in his gut knows that hes going to have to face reality here says a Republican House member speaking on background Its just a matter of the speaker being able to articulate this to those members  to the hell no caucus who are going to be unhappy with anything short of a complete and total victoryIn other words hell have to blink
