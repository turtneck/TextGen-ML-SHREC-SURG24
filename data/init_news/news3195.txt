In Florida President Obama has nominated the first openly gay black man to sit on a federal district court In New York he has nominated the first Asian American lesbian And his pick for the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit The first South AsianReelected with strong support from women ethnic minorities and gays Obama is moving quickly to change the face of the federal judiciary by the end of his second term setting the stage for another series of drawnout confrontations with Republicans in CongressThe president has named three dozen judicial candidates since January and is expected to nominate scores more over the next few months aides said The push marks a significant departure from the sluggish pace of appointments throughout much of his first term when both Republicans and some Democrats complained that Obama had not tried hard enough to fill vacancies on federal courtsThe new wave of nominations is part of an effort by Obama to cement a legacy that long outlives his presidency and makes the court system more closely resemble the changing society it governs administration officials saidDiversity in and of itself is a thing that is strengthening the judicial system White House Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler said It enhances the bench and the performance of the bench and the quality of the discussion  to have different perspectives different life experiences different professional experiences coming from a different station in life if you willBut Obamas biggest obstacle is the Senate where Republicans have frequently blocked judicial confirmation votes for months or in some cases years Obama has 35 nominees currently awaiting votes by the Senate  including several holdovers from 2012 who have been renominated this year  and there are more than 50 additional vacancies awaiting nominees according to the Federal Judicial CenterSome conservatives are skeptical of the push to name more women and minorities to the bench arguing that it amounts to unjustified affirmative action Curt Levey an outspoken Obama critic who runs the advocacy group Committee for Justice said the White House may be lowering their standards to nominate more nonwhite judgesIf theyre talking about achieving diversity through aggressive identification of minority candidates then thats their prerogative Levey said If theyre talking about doing it through preferences having a lower threshold of qualifications for minorities then I dont approve And its hard to know which theyre doing Unlike a college admissions system where its easy to quantify this is difficultDuring Obamas first term judicial nominations often fell by the wayside in the face of the economic crisis and other policy priorities at the White House Many liberal allies complained that the president did little to champion nominees once they were namedRepublicans will throw up every roadblock they can said Nan Aron president of the liberal Alliance for Justice Were counting on the White House and Senate leadership to be more assertive in getting nominees confirmedThe White House said it intends to aggressively push for more judicial nominees during Obamas second term and is hopeful that changes in filibuster rules will help speed up the process The Senate decided in January to limit debate for district court nominees from 30 hours to two hours although the restrictions do not apply to nominees for the Supreme Court or federal appeals courtsObama has already broken more barriers with his judicial appointments than any other president aides said At the circuit court level four states now have their first female justices five have their first black justices and two have their first Hispanics Sonia Sotomayor also became the first Hispanic to serve on the Supreme CourtTheres a levelingtheplayingfield goal that is kind of a frame that overrides the whole endeavor Ruemmler who oversees the nominating process said in an interviewObama a former constitutional law professor has long argued for a broad set of criteria in selecting judges When he picked Sotomayor in 2009 Obama said experience being tested by obstacles and barriers by hardship and misfortune was an important qualification for any jurist because it imparts a sense of compassion for ordinary citizensThe diversity of Obamas judicial nominees stands in contrast to staff selections at the start of his second term that have been dominated by white men including White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough Secretary of State John F Kerry Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Treasury Secretary Jack LewBy contrast 17 of the 35 pending judicial nominees are women 15 are ethnic minorities and five are openly gay according to White House statistics Six are straight white menDuring Obamas first term 37 percent of his confirmed judges were nonwhites compared with 19 percent for President George W Bush and 27 percent for President Bill Clinton The trend is similar on gender 42 percent of Obamas firstterm judges were women compared with 21 percent for Bush and 30 percent for ClintonOf the 874 federal judgeships 39 percent are held by women and 37 percent are held by nonwhites according to data kept by the Federal Judicial CenterIts very very important that these courts reflect the diversity of whats coming in terms of demographics said Nancy Zirkin of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights an advocacy group It will be his most longlasting legacy  Obama by putting on a diverse number of judges we believe will shape the courts for years to comeObama nominated Mary H Murguia for a seat on the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit Murguias parents emigrated from Mexico to Kansas where she was bornOthers include the first Haitian American AfroCaribbean Vietnamese American and Korean American judges nominated to their respective positionsOne senior Republican Senate aide who requested anonymity in order to discuss the nomination process said We are going to continue to insist on a level of quality among nomineesWere not advocating or opposing his diversity goals the aide said But that should not override the substantive qualifications of the nominees which are professional competence judicial temperament respect for the law understanding the ConstitutionLiberal groups have been pressuring the White House to look for diversity not just in race gender or sexual orientation but also in professional experience They want fewer corporate lawyers from whiteshoe firms and more public defenders and lawyers from outside what is sometimes called the judicial monasteryThats a completely different view than somebody who has only represented General Motors Zirkin saidThe Obama judges many of them in their 40s also establish a diverse bench of progressives whom Obama or future presidents could tap for Supreme Court vacanciesOne such nominee was Goodwin Liu Obamas pick in February 2010 for the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit As a Taiwanese American Liu was an historic selection But Republicans stalled his nomination for 15 months saying that his past writings showing a broad interpretation of the Constitution and his sharp criticism of conservative Supreme Court justices John G Roberts Jr and Samuel A Alito Jr were so liberal that he did not deserve an upordown voteGoodwin Liu should run for elected office not serve as a judge Sen Lindsey O Graham RSC said in a May 2011 statement Ideologues have their place just not on the benchAccording to the White House Obamas firstterm nominees took an average of 225 days to be confirmed compared with 175 days for Bush and 98 days for ClintonRuemmler said that there has been very very little substantive opposition to any of the presidents judicial nominees She pointed to the case of Robert E Bacharach a district court judge from Oklahoma whom Obama nominated last year for the US Court of Appeals for the 10th CircuitBacharachs homestate senators Tom Coburn and James M Inhofe both Republicans supported him I like the guy Inhofe told the Oklahoman I told him that its not very often the White House and I agree on anythingStill Senate Republicans filibustered Bacharachs nomination They gave no specific reason other than a vow to block all of Obamas circuit court nominees because 2012 was a presidential election year In 2004 and 2008 Senate Democrats did much the same to Bushs electionyear nomineesAfter 263 days of waiting Bacharachs nomination came to the floor for a vote on Feb 25 It passed 93 to 0
