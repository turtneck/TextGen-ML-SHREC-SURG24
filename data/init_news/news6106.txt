Jordans King Abdullah II vowed Wednesday that his military forces would hit Islamic State militants with relentless strikes upon their own homes an escalation that could place Jordan in the middle of the Syrian civil warThe king huddled with his security cabinet and top generals Wednesday just hours after Jordan hanged two convicted terrorists in retaliation against the Islamic State which posted a video Tuesday of its fighters burning alive a captured Jordanian pilot in a cageThe immolation prompted harsh condemnation from leaders across the Middle East and in the United States with the White House speaking of Jordans strength and commitment to the international coalition against the Islamic State in the face of this barbaric actThe chilling reason the Islamic State burned the pilot aliveIn Jordan the killing mostly silenced critics of the USled offensive against the Islamic State the heavily armed alQaeda offshoot also known as ISIS or ISIL It was used by the government to stoke patriotic sentiment with billboardsize posters in Amman reading We Are All Jordan and a rally of flagwaving supporters greeting the king at the airport as he arrived back in the country from a visit to the United StatesWe will be on the lookout for these criminals and we will hit them in their own homes Abdullah declared according to the state news agency Petra We are fighting this war to protect our faith values and our humanitarian principles Our fight will be relentlessThe hangings underscored the hardening stance by the monarch and his military in Jordan a key US ally in the fight against the Islamic State amid street protests calling for revenge against the militant groupThe backlash from the video  released while Abdullah was in Washington to sign a deal boosting the amount of US aid to Jordan  appears to have drawn the usually cautious monarch into a direct confrontation with radical IslamistsThe king who claims to be a descendant of the prophet Muhammad and was educated in Britain and the United States has previously avoided direct threats against the Islamic State and has sought to keep secret the number of bombing missions his air force has flown over SyriaBut according to Rep Duncan D Hunter RCalif Abdullah  who met with members of Congress before he left Washington  quoted the Clint Eastwood character William Munny an aging gunslinger in the Oscarwinning film Unforgiven who exacts vengeance when his friend is tortured to deathAbdullah did not elaborate on where or how Jordans retaliation would be carried outIt is unlikely that Jordan would fly strike missions in Syria outside those coordinated by the USdirected coalition Out of about 1000 strikes in Syria since September the vast majority have been by US aircraft But the coalition is not going to turn their nose up at additional kinetic activity by one of the members said a senior US defense official in Washington If they want to do more we welcome itOverall the coalition strategy and the pattern of strikes will not change said the official who was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on the condition of anonymity But outside of coalition operations we cant speak for Jordan the official said They might feel that for their own sense of national pride they need to do somethingThe Obama administration declined to join with the European Union  where there is no death penalty  in criticizing the rapid Jordanian executions White House press secretary Josh Earnest noted that both individuals had gone through the Jordanian justice system and were sentenced to deathThe administration did not immediately respond to a letter sent to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Secretary of State John F Kerry by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee which wrote that Abdullah in a meeting with the panel in Washington before his departure Tuesday for Amman had complained of complications and delays in providing defense items such as aircraft parts and munitionsJordans chief government spokesman said the two prisoners executed Wednesday included Sajida alRishawi an Iraqi woman sentenced to death for her role in a deadly 2005 terrorist attack in Amman The Islamic State had sought her release as part of a possible prisoner swap Jordan had offered to free Rishawi in exchange for the pilot Lt Muath alKaseasbeh and a Japanese journalist Kenji Goto held by the Islamic StateThe other inmate was Ziad alKarbouli who was linked to a terrorist attack against Jordanians in Iraq in 2005 and whose freedom was also demanded by the Islamic StateThe two were hanged less than 12 hours after the video of the pilots killing was posted onlineAcross Jordan voices that recently called for the country to withdraw from the USled offensive against the Islamic State fell silent as Jordanians came together to denounce the militantsThis terrible act has created tremendous unity in Jordan said Jawad Anani a senator and former foreign minister Ordinary Jordanians now see the threat to their own securityAnani who is close to Abdullah suggested that airstrikes by Jordan and the coalition would intensify and he said it was possible that Jordanian ground troops or special forces might be deployed in SyriaThe next logical step you can intensify the conflict Anani saidBut others doubt that the backlash will stir major changes in Muslim participation in the USled coalition against the Islamic StateThe killings impact on the coalition will not really be a gamechanger because the participation of countries depends on a variety of issues that are specific to each country said Elias Hanna a retired Lebanese general who teaches geopolitics at the American University of BeirutWe wont see Arab boots on the ground he predicted Thats for certainIn his first public statement since the video Safi alKaseasbeh the pilots father said Wednesday that he expects Jordan and the USled coalition to avenge his sons death Just last week the elder Kaseasbeh had appealed for Jordan to pull out of the coalitionI urge the government I expect the government to seek revenge severe revenge for the blood of Muath against this horrid organization this criminal organization this organization that is far from Islam and the spirit of Islam the pilots father said WednesdayRelated The Islamic State was dumped by alQaeda a year agoMembers of the extended Kaseasbeh clan greeted a stream of visitors at their mourning tent outside the city of Karak south of Amman The family had no body to bury In the video Islamic State fighters are shown dumping a bulldozer load of cement rubble over the pilots bodyMosques across Jordan held prayers for the pilot at noon with governmentsupported imams denouncing the Islamic State Meanwhile churches in Amman pealed their bells in interfaith solidarity After noon prayers Royal Jordanian Air Force fighter jets flew over Amman and KarakBut Jordan also faces tests on whether it can build on the displays of unity and resolve There have been past signs of support for the Islamic State in Jordan  especially in poorer regions  although relatively few people have waved Islamic State flags or endorsed the group on the InternetLabib Kamhawi an Ammanbased political analyst said Abdullah is in a difficult position on how to frame the responseThe issue is whether he can transform this into a national issue that affects Jordanians or whether it becomes a tribal matter with mounting calls for revenge and eyeforaneye attacks he saidHugh Naylor in Beirut and Karen DeYoung Brian Murphy and Greg Jaffe in Washington contributed to this
