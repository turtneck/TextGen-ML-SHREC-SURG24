Donald Trump finally made some bold and provocative claims that were largely true and the Republican Party finally closed ranks to attack himSaying Mexican immigrants are rapists didnt do it Calling for a return of torture didnt do it Calling for a ban on Muslim immigration didnt do it Raising questions about Barack Obamas status as an American citizen didnt do it Pretending that thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheered 911 didnt do itSo what did Trump said that invading Iraq was a disaster that the country was misled into invading Iraq by the Bush administration and that the claim that Bush kept the country safe from terrorism is ridiculous because 911 happened on his watchIt was a bizarre and telling moment in which the battered forces of the Republican establishment finally picked themselves up off the floor specifically in order to defend some of its least defensible conduct of the 21st centuryThey lied Trump said They said there were weapons of mass destruction and there were none And they knew there were none There were no weapons of mass destructionWhile Donald Trump was building a reality TV show Jeb Bush retorted my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe And Im proud of what he didThen Trump cut in with his uppercut The World Trade Center came down during your brothers reign Remember thatA chorus of boos echoed forth from the crowd packed with establishment Republicans by the state party Even better for Bush Marco Rubio  in most respects his most deadly rival in the primary  stepped in to back him upI just want to say at least on behalf of me and my family I thank God all the time it was George W Bush in the White House on 911 and not Al Gore he said According to Rubio the president to blame for 911 was not the president who was in office on 911 it was the guy who left office nine months earlier The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didnt kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill himThe audience loved this and were mightily displeased when Trump observed George Bush had the chance also and he didnt listen to the advice of his CIAI wont even hazard a guess as to whether this doublesided exchange helped or hurt Trump Watching it on television youd think Republicans there hated everything he had to say But the reality is that the instudio audience was handpicked by the state party and seemingly stuffed with Bush supportersBut if it did go badly for Trump whats fascinating is that it went badly in exactly the kind of way you would have expected Trumps campaign to go south months agoHe went way outside the boundaries of the kinds of things Republican Party politicians normally say and in response Republican Party politicians and their backers in the state party piled on to diss him A political party after all is a coalition of likeminded people When you step outside their zone of comfort and say things they wouldnt say they team up to crush youIt was primary politics as it was supposed to be And it made for a striking contrast with previous debates that had consisted largely of the establishmentfriendly candidates bashing each other on the theory that whoever came out of the establishment lane would then face down Trump one on one at some later date Chris Christies murdersuicide attack on Rubios repetition of talking points was the highestprofile example of this establishment fratricide but in truth its dominated the entire campaign leaving Republicans with not much more than wishful thinking as their antiTrump planThe strange thing is that after months of watching Trump say things that are racist absurd patently false or all three at once the Republican Party establishment decided to stomp on him for saying things that are basically trueMost obviously George W Bush clearly was in office on 911 Repeated invocations of the notion that he kept us safe have managed to make this a controversial claim but I promise you that it is true He was inaugurated in January and was serving as president on the morning of 911 when the terrorist attack momentarily interrupted his reading of My Pet Goat Bush received repeated warnings about alQaeda plots against the United States and his administration was given a plan to tackle alQaeda and the Taliban that it rejected as a holdover from the Clinton administration and a distraction from bigger problemsTrumps claim that the Bush administration positively knew there were no WMDs in Iraq is more dubious but its unquestionably true that the sort of WMD programs the White House said existed werent found and that the administrations public presentations of intelligence findings were highly skewed and selectiveBy Trump standards  this is a man after all who claims he can make Mexico pay for the construction of thousands of miles of border wall  these arguments are tame Indeed almost banal For months now Republicans have wondered how Trump could be winning by claiming up was down But this was exactly how they won in their midaughts heyday  slamming decorated war hero John Kerry for cowardice claiming to have kept the country safe while presiding over the worst terrorist attack in American history and responding by invading an unrelated country in order to dismantle a nuclear weapons program that didnt existWhen Trump contradicted the Republican Partys most cherished form of upisdownism the party establishment finally got its groove back and handed him arguably his worst evening of the entire campaign But they also proved to everyone else that pointing out that Bush was in office on 911 is a red line for the GOP establishment in a way that concocting a story about Jersey City Muslims celebrating the attacks wasnt
