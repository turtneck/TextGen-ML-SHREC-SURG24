By BAXTER DMITRI Is the st is about to hit the fan Is the fur about to start flying Maybe Its too early to tell With a new investigation promised into the true facts behind 911 there are already rumors surfacing    rumors that certain people in high places are getting a bit worried and thinking about buying oneway tickets to Tel Aviv WHODUNIT Donald Trumps plans for his first 100 days in office are raising eyebrows around the world but of all the items on his agenda it is the reopening of the 911 investigation that will provide the greatest earthquake for the establishment Trump believes that 911 has not been properly investigated and he plans to get to the bottom of it First of all the original 911 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened Trump said The election of Donald Trump has rocked the establishment and things are only going to get rockier for them during his first term There is a reason George W Bush didnt vote for Trump in the election leaving the presidential line blank and voting Republican downballot Trump has pledged to investigate 911 in a way it has not been investigated before For the first time 911 will be investigated by someone who isnt part of the establishment with skin in the game and plenty to lose First of all the original 911 investigation is a total mess and has to be reopened Trump announced to supporters How do two planes take out three buildings in the same day I never got my head around the fact that nothing is mentioned about the destruction of Building 7 in the 585 page document he explained talking about World Trade Center 7 which also collapsed  inexplicably  during the September 11 attacks Donald Trump has also taken cracks at former president George W Bush There will be no covering up for former presidents on Trumps watch The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George Bush he said in a February debate He kept us safe That is not safe That is not safe Why did the administration at the time not take legal means against Saudi Arabia Werent 19 of the highjackers from Saudi Arabia Americans deserve answers and I will definitely request a new investigation so that this horrible tragedy never happens again Donald Trump and the 911 Truth movement While Trump might be railing against the establishment in reopening the 911 investigation he has received support on this issue from a number of public personalities who have demanded the case be revisited  and not behind closed doors Former Senator Bob Graham has been demanding a new transparent investigation For years I have been campaigning for the release of the 2002 Joint Congressional Intelligence Committee 911 Inquirys report to no avail explains the former Governor of Florida These missing pages point to the direct involvement of the government of Saudi Arabia Why are these being kept secret Who has to gain from these games of secrecy he asks I have read these documents myself and if the American public knew what was in these documents there would be a revolution tomorrow in the streets of America he acknowledged during a radio interview Americans deserve to know the truth he concluded visibly angered by the whole affair Since 2002 the release of a number of 911 Commission Report documents is hindered because they are congressional records hence they are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act FOIA The long withheld 28 pages were partially released to the public this year  heavily redacted  and the Saudi government claimed the release proved they were not responsible for supporting or financing the attacks But its not as simple as that There are direct ties to the Saudi hierarchy in the 28 pages There are a lot of questions that need answering and they were never going to be addressed under a Clinton presidency with all her ties to Saudi Arabia But with President Trumps executive powers everything has changed The establishment are on edge More than half the country doesnt believe the official version of what happened that day There is now a renewed belief that this biggest of lies and cover ups is about to be dismantled The establishment did all it could to destroy Trumps election chances Now they are on edge Like this Share it now 3 thoughts on  TRUMP BOMBSHELL  Im reopening 911 Investigation  Gilbert Huntly says
