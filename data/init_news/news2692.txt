Donald Trump is loud rude bombastic and just awful  right Thats what the media is telling you Theyll play the awful Billy Bush audiotape over and over again repeat comments he made decades ago about women and recycle his What an awful woman comment during the debate But thats the side of Donald Trump the media wants you to see Perhaps the real Donald Trump is softspoken humble thoughtful and intelligent In a short video announcing the opening of his new hotel in Washington a revitalization of the old Post Office in the district Trump speaks about what it took to get the building remodeled He used the work on the post office as a metaphor for rebuilding America This building is an historical landmark a true American original he said It had all the ingredients of greatness but it has been neglected and left to deteriorate for many many decades It sat there so beautiful and so empty and was falling into a very very bad state of condition It had the foundation for success All of the elements were here Our job was to restore it to its former glory honor its heritage but also to imagine a brand new and exciting vision Everyone should watch this video No yelling no screaming Just Donald Trump explaining how to make America great again
