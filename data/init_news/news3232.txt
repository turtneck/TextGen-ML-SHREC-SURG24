by JerriLynn Scofield JerriLynn here I first became aware of the consequences of Hanjins collapse via Lamberts coverage in Water Cooler The South Korean governments bailout strategy a version of kick the can down the road looks worrying and unsustainable given the ongoing slowdown in world trade  with little cause for optimism that trend will reverse anytime soon As Richter indicates much more pain is sure to follow By Wolf Richter a San Francisco based executive entrepreneur start up specialist and author with extensive international work experience Originally published at Wolf Street The ravaged shipbuilding industry in South Korea deemed too big to fail is getting its largest taxpayer bailout yet totaling 96 billion on top of the bailout funds already handed out last year and on top of another 96 billion this year to bail out stateowned banks that were getting slammed by defaulting loans extended to the shipping industry Their problem according to trade ministry cited by the Wall Street Journal  orders for new ships to be built in South Korea have collapsed by 87 over the past nine months from the already terrible 9month period last year to almost nothing South Korean container carrier Hanjin was allowed to collapse in August It shattered the complacency that TBTF carriers are immune to failure It is now getting chopped into pieces to be sold off under bankruptcy court orders Its rival Hyundai Merchant Marine was bailed out and restructured earlier this year Other carriers around the globe have been sunk by two years of excruciating low shipping rates triggered by rampant overcapacity and stagnating world trade Larger carriers are consolidating to survive Just on Monday Japans Big Three  Nippon Yusen Mitsui OSK Lines and Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha  announced that they would merge to form the worlds sixth largest container carrier These carriers have stopped ordering ships and many have canceled orders and Chinese shipbuilders have muscled into the market years ago to grab share by slashing prices and they too are going bankrupt  But the shipbuilding industry is special to South Korea a country whose economy depends on exports The worlds three largest shipbuilders by erstwhile order volume are Korean Hyundai Heavy Industries Daewoo Shipbuilding  Marine Engineering and Samsung Heavy Industries In 2015 the industry accounted for 71 of South Koreas manufacturing jobs and 76 of exports The beleaguered Big Three have already sold noncore assets and sloughed off employees as part of prior bankled restructuring plans Theyre dealing with terrible economic dynamics Global orders for ships peaked in 2007 at over 90 million compensated gross tonnage CGT of which about onethird went to Korean shipbuilders Orders crashed during the Financial Crisis to a low of 18 million CGT in 2009 then recovered In 2013 orders maxed out at 60 million CGT still down 33 from the prior peak Those were the good times In 2016 so far orders have collapsed to only 9 million CGT according to the Wall Street Journal Thats about half of the orders during the worst part of the Financial Crisis And South Koreas share of this pittance in orders has fallen from onethird to just a tiny sliver So on Monday South Korean Finance Minister Yoo Ilho announced another big bailout program to help the shipbuilding industry deal with the order cliff the government would directly order vessels and also provide financing for shipping companies to order vessels In total this would generate orders for 250 vessels through 2020 valued at 11 trillion won 96 billion funded by the government But these ships wont be the big traditional money makers such as large containerships and drybulk carriers of which the world is already vastly oversupplied Instead these will be vessels for the fishing industry and for small shipping companies along with ferries patrol boats warships and coastguard vessels The hope is this will carry shipyards into the next glory period when world trade and shipbuilding would resurge For now the government is hoping to keep the Big Three shipbuilders alive They will have to shed 32 of their workforce by 2018 cut their operations by 23 sell more noncore businesses and take other measures This bailout comes on top of prior bailouts including the one of Daewoo Shipbuilding  Marine Engineering in October 2015 when the stateowned ExportImport Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Bank which already owned a controlling 315 stake handed it a 37 billion bailout package of new loans a rights offering and debttoequity swaps The South Korean shipbuilders werent just sunk by the collapse of the global shipping industry but also by their expedition into new territories Seeing over the years that orders for big vessels would be heading south and that prices were under pressure from competition in China they decided in 2010 to get into the nirvana of profits building offshore oil rigs But that turned into a nightmare and heavy losses even before the price of oil crashed In June the government and the Bank of Korea set up a special fund of 11 trillion won 96 billion to recapitalize staterun banks which were getting hit by defaulting loans from carriers and shipbuilders In addition the finance ministry said the government would offer 65 trillion won 56 billion for South Korean carriers to order new bigger vessels to improve their profit margins and survive a little longer And then there are plans to create a statebacked shipfinancing company with initial capital of 1 trillion won 880 million No one knows for sure how long the misery in the shipbuilding and shipping industries will continue Overcapacity is a terrible condition Creating it benefits many on the way up It enriches them and makes the economy look good But when it comes home to roost the price is stiff People lose their jobs And many of the costs will be socialized Its only then that you see just how much capital has already gone down the drain and how much more will follow The pain will continue with many more falsehopeups and brutal smackdowns and more carriers will crack under their debt Read Why Hanjins Zombie Collapse Wont Be the Last One  0 0 0 0 0 0 This entry was posted in Guest Post on
