On the eve of the New Hampshire primary Hillary Clintons quest to become the countrys first female president has encountered an unexpected problem She is having trouble persuading women young and old to rally behind her causeThe latest sign came Sunday when a new CNNWMUR survey here showed Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont beating Clinton among women by eight percentage points  which represents a big shift from the results last week in the Iowa caucuses where Clinton won women by 11 pointsThe survey followed unintentionally problematic comments over the weekend by Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem older trailblazers who were trying to encourage younger women to support ClintonSteinem apologized Sunday for saying on a TV appearance Friday night that younger women were supporting Sanders because the boys are with Bernie On Saturday Albright drew criticism for saying that theres a special place in hell for women who dont help each other even though she has expressed that sentiment many times beforeClintons struggles with women underscore the extent to which she has not yet figured out how to harness the historymaking potential of her candidacy in the same way that Barack Obama mobilized minorities and white liberals excited about electing the first black presidentMeet the feminists who want a man in the White HouseCognizant of the challenge the Clinton campaign has sought in recent days here to address the problem tweaking her speeches to put a focus on Clinton as an advocate for women Clinton spent part of Friday with a group of female US senators she calls the sisterhood of the traveling pantsuitsAt the Saturday event with Albright Clinton offered an aspirational message  saying that the countrys history is one of rising of knocking down barriers of moving toward a more perfect union  that appeared designed to present her candidacy as a milepost on that national journeyIn an appearance on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday Clinton defended Albright saying that her words were a lighthearted but very pointed remark which people can take however they chooseI think what she was trying to do what shes done in every setting Ive ever seen her in going back 20plus years was to remind young women particularly that you know this struggle which many of us have been part of is not over Clinton saidSteinem wrote on her Facebook page that her remarks to comedian Bill Maher in which she seemed to say that proSanders feminists were just looking for dating opportunities was a case of talkshow InterruptusI misspoke on the Bill Maher show recently and apologize for whats been misinterpreted as implying young women arent serious in their politics she wroteEven so Steinems comments pointed to the unexpected obstacle facing Clinton and her backers a deep divide among women and feminist activists over how voters should respond to herWhile many older womens rights advocates see the election of Clinton as the next logical step in a broader movement some younger activists have expressed resentment at the notion that they should feel obligated to vote for Clinton simply because shes a woman Some have argued in recent months that Sanders with his calls to end income inequality and make college free is arguably the more feminist candidateIn Flint Clinton casts herself as a problemsolver  and looks past NHHillary doesnt seem to address those huge issues said Alexis Isabel Moncada whose feministculture Twitter account launched in April and boasts 170000 followersMoncada who is 17 but will be old enough to vote in November said Clintons personal wealth and her life as a former first lady and secretary of state create a disconnect with the entirety of womenOn the trail Clinton has begun to show more openness and reflection about the challenges of running as a woman in office sometimes in response to challenges from other womenAt a student town hall at New England College on Saturday a young woman told Clinton that she supported her in 2008 but has doubts about her candidacy nowMy concern is that your answer that nothing new was found in the Benghazi hearings continues to give me some doubts the woman said Everybody knows you cant write 30000 emails to your yoga instructorAnother young woman asked why her peers think that Clinton is too buttoned up and rehearsedI do have a somewhat narrower path that Ive tried to walk I do think sometimes it comes across as a little more restrained a little more careful and Im sure thats true Clinton answered Its not just about me its about young women women of all ages the expectations that are put upon you and how you deal with them and how you find your true voice and how you stand up for yourself and who you becomeMany womens rights advocates say they are proud to back Clinton not just because of her gender but also because of her vast experience as a lawyer first lady senator and secretary of stateThe Fix Why wont Clinton release the transcripts of those paid speechesIn recent weeks Clinton has won endorsements from numerous womens rights organizations including the Planned Parenthood Action Fund the National Organization for Women Emilys List NARAL ProChoice America and the Feminist MajorityFeminist Majoritys president Eleanor Smeal who launched a campaign on Clintons behalf SheWins We Win said in an interview that Clinton has not only fought for womens rights here and overseas but is probably the strongest single candidate that has ever challenged for the presidencySome have argued that they will vote for Clinton precisely because shes a womanThere has never been a president who knows what its like to menstruate be pregnant or give birth Kate Harding 41 wrote in the online womens magazine Dame shortly after Clinton declared her candidacy Nor Harding said has there been a president who has faced such blatant sexism for showing too much cleavage or having cankles or wearing unflattering headbandsA question for Clinton is whether she can use what is looking to be an extended primary campaign against Sanders to energize women for the general election should she win the nominationRepublican frontrunner Donald Trump traded accusations of sexism with Clinton prompting a reexamination of the support Clinton won from feminists in the 90s when she defended her husband against accusations that threatened to derail his presidencyNew Wave Feminism Todays generation embraces feminism on its own termsKate Michelman a former NARAL president and a prominent supporter of Clintons candidacy echoes Clintons own evocation of a vast rightwing conspiracy in arguing that the forces of sexism and antifeminism are going to be loud and clear in their attempt to make sure no women get the presidency of this countryAnd some selfidentified feminists say they feel less urgency to elect a woman in 2016 than they did eight years ago perhaps because this is the second time a woman has come so closeShelby Knox 29 subject of a documentary about campaigning for sex education in Texas schools was living and working with Steinem in 2008 and said she found the attacks so painful she was almost scared to see Clinton announce againWhen Hillary lost I had this horrible fear that Gloria Steinem would never see a woman president said Knox as if the nation would reject any womanThis time around she is confident Clinton will win And even if she doesnt Knox thinks she will live to see a female presidentIt will be impossible for us not to have a woman president she said I have no doubt it will happenSellers reported from Washington Karen Tumulty in
