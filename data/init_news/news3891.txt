Matthew C Makel et al Science Direct October 31 2016 Abstract Malefemale ability differences in the right tail at or above the 95th percentile have been widely discussed for their potential role in achievement and occupational differences in adults The present study provides updated malefemale ability ratios from 320000 7th grade students in the United States in the right tail top 5 through the extreme right tail top 001 from 2011 to 2015 using measures of math verbal and science reasoning Additionally the present study establishes malefemale ability ratios in a sample of over 7000 7th grade students in the right tail from 2011 to 2015 in India Results indicate that ratios in the extreme right tail of math ability in the US have shrunk in the last 20 years still favoring males and remained relatively stable in the verbal domain still favoring females Similar patterns of malefemale ratios in the extreme right tail were found in the Indian sample
