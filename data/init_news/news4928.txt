While investigators try to piece together what led the Orlando gunman to carry out an unspeakable act of terror the attack is upending the 2016 campaign debate as the two presumptive rivals go toetotoe on terror with two very different messagesIn backtoback speeches Monday Donald Trump doubled down on his call for a Muslim immigration ban while decrying what he described as a deadly ignorance that is hurting the country  and Hillary Clinton renewed her call for an assaultweapons ban while vowing to stop lone wolf terroristsTrump speaking in New Hampshire focused largely on his plans for an immigration crackdown Trump said he wants to suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the US or its alliesWe have no choice Trump said of the proposed banIt wasnt immediately clear whether Trump was revising his longstanding proposal to temporarily bar foreign Muslims entering the US which he also defended or referring to the same planThe New York businessman also called the Orlando shooting an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives love who they want and express their identityIt we dont get tough and we dont get smart  and fast  were not going to have a country anymore  there will be nothing left Trump saidTrump speaking at St Anselm College was quick to slam his Democratic rival claiming she is in total denial and that her ultimate plan is to disarm lawabiding Americans while admitting immigrants who could pose a threatA few hours earlier at her speech in Ohio Clinton called for an intelligence surge and a ban on assault weapons as part of a multipronged strategy to confront homegrown terrorismThe presumptive Democratic presidential nominee following the Orlando terror attack called on Americans to fight terrorism at home with clear eyes and steady hands She delivered a carefully calibrated message calling for America to get tougher on terrorists while also renewing gun control proposals that have failed to gain steam in CongressAt the Cleveland campaign event she drew cheers from the crowd after calling for a ban on assault weaponsWeapons of war have no place on our streets Clinton saidClinton also said if she were in the White House a top priority would be identifying and stopping lone wolves like the Orlando shooterShe also called for increased efforts to remove Islamic State messages from the Internet and said peaceloving Muslims are in the best position to help fight radicalizationTrumps speech was originally supposed to focus on his case against the Clintons  but Trump changed his focus following the attack in Orlando that left 49 people dead and dozens injured The gunman died in a shootout with policeOn Monday President Obama said investigators believe the gunman was not directed by external extremist groups instead saying the shooter was inspired by various extremist information that was disseminated over the InternetHe added that there is no direct evidence the shooter was part of a larger plotClinton warned earlier Monday against demonizing an entire religion saying doing so would play into the hands of the Islamic State groupWe can call it radical jihadism we can call it radical Islamism Clinton said on CNNs New Day But we also want to reach out to the vast majority of AmericanMuslims and Muslims around this country this world to help us defeat this threat which is so evil and has got to be denounced by everyone regardless of religionThe horrific shooting consumed the White House race just as Trump and Clinton were fully plunging into the general election It served as a reminder to the candidates and voters alike that the next president will lead a nation facing unresolved questions about how to handle threats that can feel both foreign and all too familiarTrump said Monday he was revoking the press credentials of the Washington Post after the newspaper published an article with a headline Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shootingBased on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post Trump posted on his Facebook pageAuthorities identified the killer in Orlando as Omar Mateen a 29yearold Americanborn Muslim FBI officials said they had investigated him in 2013 and 2014 on suspicion of terrorist sympathies but could not make a case against himMateen opened fire at the Pulse Orlando club with an AR15 semiautomatic rifle He called 911 during the attack to profess his allegiance to the Islamic State terrorist organization though it was unclear whether he had any direct contact with ISIS or was just inspired by themThe Associated Press contributed to this report
