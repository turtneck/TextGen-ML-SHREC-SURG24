Email The liberal internet sites and some in social media actually believe that the acquittal on all charges brought against the Bundys and five others last week for their peaceful protest and occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon was a sign of white privilege  One outlet even allowed a black columnist to write that white privilege was now weaponized Consider the moronic claim of Chauncey Devega at Salon  Just consider An allwhite jury acquitted militant religious fundamentalists whose avowed aim is hurting the US Excuse me Hurting the US How so Mr Devega Well according to Mr Devega Despite the overwhelming evidence against the Bundy militants on Thursday a federal jury in Portland acquitted them of federal weapons and conspiracy charges This shocked many observers It should not have Black Americans and other people of color often talk about how there is one legal system for them and another for us he added What is this evidence of which he speaks Well he doesnt quite tell us He never mentions any laws that were broken Its not against the law to keep and bear arms  Its not against the law to go and occupy an area that is supposed to be under the peoples control per the Constitution Technically per the Constitution the land does not belong to the central government Its not against the law to hold a press conference there Its not against the law to address your government for grievances In fact all those things are a part of the law Oh and what does Mr Devega have to say about this photo with a black man standing with LaVoy Finicum and Pete Santilli  Does that look like white privilege to you Did LaVoy Finicum receive white privilege Chauncey I dont think so The tyranny you are supporting murdered him in cold blood and now a jury has determined that they were doing nothing wrong that should have warranted their arrest nor his murder How about the months these men sat in jail in Oregon while being denied bail Was that white privilege What about the fact they are facing similar trumped up charges in Nevada from something that took place two years ago and are still sitting in jail Is that white privilege Chauncey He then went on to ask if Muslims did this would it be terrorism I can answer that yes However the reason why I can affirm that is because they would have created violence just as they are taught to do in the Koran as they follow in the footsteps of their founder Muhammad They usually do The only violence at Bundy Ranch or in Oregon was the result of the Oregon State Police  the FBI  and the Bureau of Land Management  Those were the people with guns pointed at citizens despite Devegas claims otherwise If that was not enough Devega forgot that a Native American woman Sheila M Warren testified on behalf of the defense Was that your white privilege Mr Devega As the socialmedia hashtag CrimingWhileWhite signals there is a dual system of justice in the United States of America One exists for white people  especially white conservatives and other members of the right wing  and a separate one for people of color and Muslims added Devega This is white privilege weaponized through the law Devega is not the only one to put forth this nonsense New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof also claimed this acquittal may have been racially motivated Other people on social media chimed in making the same ridiculous claims without ever once citing any law that was broken Terrorism is legal when ur white httpstcoewFsaRpJVJ
