Hillary Rodham Clinton sought to cement her standing as the rightful leader of the Democratic Party here Friday but two of her challengers launched a fierce counterattack against her and a party establishment they see as trying to hand her the 2016 presidential nominationWhat began as a routine forum of candidate speeches evolved into a surprisingly dramatic day at the Democratic National Committees summer meeting as Sen Bernie Sanders IVt and former Maryland governor Martin OMalley issued thinly veiled attacks on Clinton and the party leadershipSpeaking from the dais with DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz sitting a few feet away OMalley blasted the partys limited number of sanctioned debates as a process rigged in favor of the frontrunner The DNC is holding six debates only four before Februarys first caucuses in Iowa which OMalley argued is a disadvantage for all the candidates and a disservice to Democrats generallyThis sort of rigged process has never been attempted before said OMalley who has struggled to gain traction in the polls He added We are the Democratic Party not the undemocratic partySanders  who later told reporters he agreed with OMalley  lamented low Democratic turnout in last years midterm elections and said the party must grow beyond politics as usual if it hopes to produce the level of voter enthusiasm required to retain the White House in 2016We need a movement which takes on the economic and political establishment not one which is part of that establishment said Sanders who is an independent but caucuses with Democrats in the SenateAsked later whether he was speaking specifically about Clinton he told reporters Ill let you use your imagination on thatThe barbs from Sanders and OMalley came as Clinton and her campaign flexed their organizational muscle here The frontrunner and her top aides worked aggressively behind the scenes this week to secure commitments from party leaders pledging to be delegates for her in next summers nominating convention in PhiladelphiaClintons organizational push sent a clear signal to Vice President Biden who has been weighing a late entry into the 2016 campaign that he would begin far behind herIn her address to a ballroom full of DNC members Clinton sought to position herself as the undisputed Democratic standardbearer She fired up the party faithful with a call to arms against Republicans as dangerously out of touch and peppered her remarks with gibes at current GOP frontrunner Donald Trump  including a suggestion that his hair although natural is dyed like her ownThe party of Lincoln has become the party of Trump Clinton said She mocked Trump for suggesting that she did not understand womens health issues and that he would be a better advocate Now thats a general election debate thats going to be a lot of fun she saidClinton said that Trump is getting most of the media attention this summer but that the other Republican candidates are making statements that ought to scare mainstream voters Theyre Trump without the pizazz and the hair she saidClinton made no reference in her speech to the controversy surrounding her use of a private email server while secretary of state When asked about it later in a news conference Clinton said I have said repeatedly that I did not send nor receive classified material and Im very confident when this entire process plays out that will be understood by everyone It will prove what I have been sayingFormer Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee raised eyebrows when he touted himself as scandalfree in his remarks He later said this was not a direct swipe at anybody But pressed on how Clinton has handled the email issue Chafee said The rules are the rules and we all have to adhere to them and when you dont you suffer the consequences Unfortunately this is selfinflictedThe fifth declared candidate former senator Jim Webb of Virginia did not attend because he was taking his daughter to collegeOMalley used his time onstage to highlight his dissatisfaction with the DNCs management of the debates He argued forcefully that as Trump and other Republican candidates dominate news coverage with inflammatory rhetoric Democrats would be wise to hold more not fewer nationally televised debates to highlight the differences between the partiesWill we let the circus run unchallenged on every channel while we cower in shadows under a decree of silence in the ranks Or will we demand equal time to showcase our ideas OMalley askedHe slammed what he called a cynical move to limit the debates to six and to hold the only New Hampshire debate on a Saturday night in midDecember the peak of the holiday shopping seasonWhose decree is this exactly he asked provocatively Where did it come from To what end or purposeWasserman Schultz who was visibly miffed by OMalleys speech said in an interview Thursday that she had consulted widely with past DNC chairs as well as with the campaigns before setting the debate scheduleWe felt like this structure for actual debates was really the best one that could give maximum exposure that voters need to make a decision but that also would be manageable and give the candidates the opportunity and the time to go out and campaign in a retail way she said
