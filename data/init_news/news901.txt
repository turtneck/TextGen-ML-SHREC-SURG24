Hey you Any interest in running for the US House or maybe better the US Senate A few seats are up for grabs in 2016 Its a very powerful prestigious decently wellpaying job Lots of important decisions Great on a rsumWhats that you say Not interested Not for you Yeah I get it I wouldnt want to run for Congress either I know youre probably a reasonable person a nuanced thinker with a bit of an independent streak You dont want to get drawn into the maw of that tribal trench warfare down there on the DC swamp Its a bitter angry place And no funBut hey somebody has to do the job And flippant tone aside it really matters who does do the job If reasonable levelheaded people like you dont want to run for Congress that means only haironfire ideologues will put run the place and  oh wait That does seem to be happening a bit these daysWhich takes us to that upcoming 2016 congressional election Yet another golden opportunity to bring some fresh talent into Washington maybe for some folks who are more excited about governing than about trying to make government disappear altogetherIf such optimism sounds like the triumph of hope over experience it probably is Which raises an important question Why dont we get many moderates especially moderate Republicans running for office these daysIve gathered here two good explanations from some recent political science literatureSay youre a moderate Republican You might look at the Republican Party in Congress and feel like its not exactly your people in charge of the place Youd see that the leaders in Congress tend to be on the extremist side and youd make a reasonable guess that you wouldnt get too far in Congress as a moderate By contrast if youre a True Conservative youd see an opportunity to fit right inThis is the Party Fit hypothesis as developed by political scientist Danielle Thomsen in a paper titled Ideological Moderates Wont Run How Party Fit Matters for Partisan Polarization in Congress She also has a forthcoming book on this Thomsen looked at some surveys of state legislators and some data on who actually runs for Congress Her conclusion based on the data is simple The more liberal the Republican state legislator the less likely she is to run for Congress the more conservative the Democratic state legislator the less likely she is to do soIn an email Thomsen told me that there are indeed moderates in the state legislatures She estimates that about 20 of Republican state legislators are as liberal as former Senator Olympia Snowe RME and nearly 30 of Democratic state legislators are as conservative as former representative John Tanner DTN Its just that they are much less likely to run for CongressLike most aspects of polarization the party fit story is asymmetrical  the polarizing impact is much stronger for Republicans Democrats have maintained more ideological diversity and get more moderates to run This is not true for RepublicansAnd like most aspects of polarization it feeds on itself As Thomsen also wrote in her email to me As moderates gradually lost their place in both parties polarization has become selfreinforcing The hyperpartisanship in Congress has discouraged moderates from running for and remaining in Congress which has further exacerbated the ideological distance between the partiesAgain say youre a moderate Republican Chances are your local and state party leaders are not all that interested in encouraging you to run Most likely they are ideologues themselves and theyd like to find people who share their beliefs especially if they are Republicans They want True ConservativesThis is a conclusion I draw from a fascinating survey of 6000 countylevel political party leaders conducted by political scientists David Broockman Nicholas Carnes Melody CrowderMeyer and Christopher Skovron They asked what qualities party leaders wantedSure the party leaders said they looked for the usual things  honesty experience intelligence dedication good looks and yes ability to raise moneyBut they also cared about ideology  particularly the Republicans Broockman et al writeAnd party leaders do play a very important role in candidate recruitment as Broockman documented in a separate paper In pretty much every study trying to explain why candidates decided to run for office recruitment was a major factorAgain we have a selfreinforcing loop here The more ideologues run the party the more they are going to recruit other likeminded candidates to run for officeThere is also probably a fundraising aspect to this Most of the big donors tend to bepretty ideological again especially on the right If they give a lot of money its almost always because they feel very strongly that one or the other of the two major parties needs to be in charge Active passion and strong partisanship tend to go togetherFor example in explaining leapfrog representation the phenomenon of extremist candidates jumping over the median voter in a district when a seat changes partisan control political scientists Joseph Bafumi and Michael C Herron point that active donors tend to be more extreme than nondonors They argue that this may offer one explanation why candidates do not converge on the middle  if you cant raise money from ideological donors its harder to run for officeSure you might argue party leaders may be ideologues themselves especially on the right But most of all they want to stay in power And to stay in power they need to win elections And to win elections they need to converge on the median voter who is by definition in the middle of the leftright ideological distribution Ergo the moderating pressures of electoral competition should overcome these forces of extremismFair enough In close races party leaders may indeed face a tradeoff between ideology and electabilityBut one problem is there just arent that many close racesBy the latest Cook Political Report 2016 projections 378 out of 435 House seats are considered safe  thats 87 percent Add in the 25 likely seats and were at 403 out of 435 or 93 percent at low or no risk So it doesnt matter whether parties pick moderates or ideologues  theyre almost certainly going to win as long as they dont pick a convicted felon or maybe even if they doIn the Senate 19 or 33 seats up in 2016 are solid for one party or another by the Cook assessment If we add in the likely seats were at 25 or 33 or 75 percent low or no risk In state legislatures meanwhile 43 percent of seats are not even contestedIn other words the proposed moderation of the median voter theory doesnt have very many seats on which to work its supposed magicBut then again its not even clear that competitive elections actually bring candidates to the middle Research by political scientists Anthony Fowler and Andrew B Hall suggests that partisans who win in close congressional elections vote just as extreme as partisans who win by landslides Fowler and Hall conclude Elected officials do not adapt their rollcall voting to their districts preferences over time and  voters do not systematically respond by replacing incumbentsNo wonder then that political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have described the median voter theory as a failure in a recent paper criticizing the Downsian paradigm Anthony Downs popularized the median voter theory As Hacker and Pierson conclude Parties not only fail to converge they diverge asymmetrically One key reason for this they argue is that organized interests within the parties make strong demands and party leaders will be attentive to such demands because groups can provide resources they need offering critical financial and organizational supportOkay so youre probably not going to run for Congress in 2016 Nor am IBut somebody out there is going to put up with all the endless fundraising calls and the invasions of privacy and the negative ads attacking them and the endless recitation of the same platitudinous speeches over and over again And especially on the right that somebody is probably going to be an ideologue Because who else wants to run these days And who else do party leaders want to recruitThe obvious suggestion is that we need to get some different people running for national office  again especially on the rightMore broadly we might want to think a little more about the pipeline of whos getting involved in politics at all And yeah we probably also ought to do something about this problem of only a tiny share of the millennial generation viewing politics as a worthwhile career But theres plenty of time ahead to work through these problemsSo watch this space for some ideas in the months ahead Im going to be thinking a bit about this problemThis post is
