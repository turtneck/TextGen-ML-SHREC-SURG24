Fans Thrilled as NFL Team Stands for Anthem Then Players Unleash Sick Surprise I think the brand is hotter than its ever been but it doesnt matter to me I dont care Trump stated in a taped interview that aired Thursday on ABCs Good Morning America It doesnt matter I dont care about the brand I care about the country His words were echoed by his son Eric who also felt confident about the survivability of the familys brand in the face of relentless attacks I think we have the hottest brand in the world right now and I think buildings like this are a testament to what we do every day Eric Trump said referring to the hotel that had just opened ahead of schedule and under budget   There has been some damage attempted against the family business via negative press and spiteful boycotts such as the meanspirited campaign to ruin Ivanka Trumps clothing and accessories line by tying it to the leaked 2005 tape of Trump making vulgar comments about certain women However Donald Trump Jr insisted that in spite of the negative press the brand was doing just fine and was even expanding proving it was far more than just a real estate development group tied to the New York City and tristate area The brand is much more than New York City This is a global brand Trump Jr said I mean when you look at the people hes touching on a daily basis the presidency fixing America is so much bigger than any of that regardless Granted it is entirely possible that the Trump brand will suffer longterm from the unceasing onslaught of negative coverage though it is also just as likely that the brand could even grow in popularity depending upon how the 2016 election ultimately plays out
