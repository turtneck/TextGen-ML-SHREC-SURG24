The unrest at a Trump event was a symbol of a nation of partisans who dont trust each other But it also highlighted a way forwardHow SNLs the bubble sketch about polarization is all too trueFor one night Chicagos Harrison Street might as well have been Capitol HillOn one side of the street stood supporters of Donald Trump upset that a campaign rally had been canceled On the other stood protesters against Mr Trump  the reason the rally had been canceled By the end of the night the tension led to violence and recriminationsFor all the grandiose talk this primary season about whom America should choose as president to fix Washington or make America great again it was right there  on that Friday night in Chicago  that Americas democratic experiment was playing out on its most basic levelThe protests violence and general chaos that enveloped the presidential race this weekend gave the impression that American politics was spinning out of controlTo the contrary it was further evidence that the American political process has perhaps never been under tighter controlNot of the establishment Of the votersFriday night in Chicago showed that there is little mystery about politics today Washington is divided and angry because American voters are divided and angry In the nottoodistant past parties acted as a buffer wringing some measure of concord from Congresss cacophony of voicesNo moreThe parable of this election so far has been the impotence of the establishmentJust think how many times and ways the Republican establishment has tried to get Trump to play by anything approaching the rule book And who in the Democratic National Committee really wants Bernie Sanders to still be in the raceThe trend has been building for years Former House Speaker John Boehner did not want the tea party agenda The voters forced his hand The parties are by no means dead but their influence is a shadow of what it once wasWhich brings America right back to Harrison StreetWhat this weekend showed in the starkest terms yet was that the only practical solution to the problems that seem to beset America is the American voterIf red and blue America  separated by a few feet of asphalt and wildly different worldviews  cant find a way to get along then Congress doesnt have tools to either Nor would any presidentDespite claims to the contrary the establishment can do little of substance without voter buyin In searching for the element that has unified Trump voters across economic and geographic groups ABC News found that the single most predictive factor was anger at the establishmentCompared with other factors an ABC News poll found that the idea that Trumps popularity is fundamentally based on anger against the existing political establishment and the sense that an outsider is needed to fix it have significantly more legsSome 82 percent of Trump supporters say they prefer an outsider the poll foundIndeed America sits at a unique confluence of political history suggests Bruce Schulman of ReutersThe influence of the parties is declining as the partisanship of voters is risingThe result is that tensions are increasing at a time when the parties ability to manage them is diminishingFor much of the nations history partisan attachments burned just as hot  if not hotter  than they do today but strong party organizations disciplined their members and formed effective tools of governance he writes As party organizations weakened and partisan ties gradually atrophied after World War Two space opened up for the influence of a wide variety of interest groups and the emergence of different but nonetheless workable models of policymaking Now fierce partisanship has reemerged  but without effective party organization or authority to police itThe reasons for the decline of the party are many he says from the rise of organized interests to mass media supplanting the party organization as the principal intermediary between elected officials and ordinary votersBut the development leaves the country with no political referees The task of governing falls largely to the voters by default And at this moment that is a recipe for divisionMore than a quarter of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents 27 percentsaid that the other partys positions are so misguided that they threaten the nations wellbeing according to a 2014 Pew Research Center study More than onethird of Republicans and Republicanleaning independents 36 percent said the same These make up the core of primary votersAs the Monitors Peter Grier noted in a cover story swing voters are disappearing Even declared independents tend to vote for one side consistently and many are votingagainst a party rather than for itParties have played their part in fueling antagonism for the other party Voters have also sorted themselves along partisan lines in recent years  meaning there are few conservative Democrats or liberal Republicans anymoreThe result is a political system that has little common ground Weak parties may well make effective governance all but impossibleMr Schulman of Reuters saysBut the decline of parties also makes the way forward apparent if not easy It comes down to what voters want and the solution to the status quo is clearly not further polarizationThere is a tendency on the left and the right to associate primarily with likeminded people to the point of actively avoiding those who disagree the Pew study found Not surprisingly this tendency is also tightly entwined with the growing level of partisan antipathy In both political parties those with strongly negative views of the other side are more likely to be those who seek out compatible viewpointsThis weekend that divide was not bluered or RepublicanDemocrat but a Chicago street
