Last week an NPR analysis found Hillary Clinton outperforms Bernie Sanders in the states with the most income inequality This weekend on Meet the Press host Chuck Todd asked about that trend we discovered Why would Sanders do worse in those states when income inequality is his signature issueWe decided to look into that claimDo lowerincome Americans vote that much less than the rest of the population And did 80 percent of poor Americans really not vote in 2014Sanders may be off on that 80 percent figure especially depending on how you define poor But his broader point stands Poorer Americans do vote less than richer AmericansWe reached out to the Sanders campaign about these stats and they sent us a source a 2015 Pew report on financial insecurity and voting patterns In that report Pew separated Americans into five different groups based on their levels of financial security derived from their responses to questions about how hard it is to pay their bills whether they receive meanstested benefits like SNAP and so onFinancially insecure doesnt exactly mean poor but Pew itself calls measures of income a blunt measure explaining that its insecurity index is a more nuanced look at peoples daytoday financial situationsThose financially insecure people were much less likely to vote than the people with firmer financial footing In that lowestsecurity group only 20 percent of people were likely voters in that SeptemberOctober 2014 survey according to a Pew scale that determined a persons likelihood of voting But the likelihood of voting goes up as financial security does  63 percent of the most financially secure Americans were considered likely votersSo did 20 percent end up votingCensus data says they did  and then some Pew didnt exactly study based on income but when the Census Bureau did in 2014 it found that among Americans in families making less than 10000 the lowest income group they studied 245 percent voted 651 percent of those people said they didnt vote the other 103 percent were classified as nonrespondentsSo up to 755 percent of those very lowest income families didnt vote in 2014 that is the nonvoters plus the nonrespondents Thats close to 80 percent which lends some weight to Sanders claimBut only some weight That nonvoting share may also be as low as 65 percent given those nonrespondentsNot only that but there are plenty of people who make more than 10000 per year who could still be considered poor or in Pews study financially insecure After all that group of people in families making 10000 or less is only around 31 percent of all US adults There are plenty more people in the US who are poor by one definition or anotherAnd the higher the income over that 10000 mark the more people voted in 2014 according to the Census Bureau meaning that as income gets higher the further the voting rate gets from that 20 percent markSo Sanders may be stretching it on that 80 percent figureHowever his broader point stands Lowerincome people do tend to vote less than higherincome people In those census data voting rates go up with income levels  the highestincome group people in families making 150000 or more also had the highest turnout at 566 percentThis doesnt just happen in midterms other Census data from 2012 similarly show higher voting rates as income climbsAnd for further reading here are two great analyses of this trend of lowincome voters low turnout one from Sean McElwee in Politico Magazine in January 2015 and one from Daniel Weeks in the Atlantic in January 2014Sanders answer was meant to address why he didnt perform better in unequal states But its not clear that if more poorer people voted in the primaries and caucuses that Sanders would have performed better In some states like Iowa and Massachusetts he performed close to or better than Clinton among lowerincome people while higherincome people preferred her according to entrance and exit pollsBut as John Dickerson pointed out on CBSs Face the Nation this weekend there were several states in which the trend was reversedIn states like Ohio Florida New York and even Michigan which you won those who would be  those earning less than 30000 ended up voting more for Hillary Clinton So that doesnt seem to be the case he saidIts possible that more poor people turning out might help Sanders more  after all many young people who have been reliable sources of support for Sanders are in school and earning little and many others are at the start of their careers earning less than their older counterpartsBut if the trend seen in the exit polls thus far held and more of those lowerincome people turned out they might not have boosted Sanders all that muchAt any rate one other important point The fact that so many Americans dont vote and that those people tend to disproportionately be lowerincome matters in election outcomesIn a 2014 report Pew found that nearly half of nonvoters that is people who werent registered or who were unlikely to vote had a family income of less than 30000 compared with 19 percent of votersAnd those nonvoters had measurably different political views in some areas from likely voters Nonvoters were more likely to be Democrats or lean Democrat and they also were more likely to say that government aid to the poor does more good than harmOne other interesting facet of the interaction between income and turnout As McElwee pointed out in that Politico article research suggests that higher class bias in the electorate actually leads to higher levels of income inequality So if this trend of lower turnout among lowerincome Americans continues it could make inequality the trend Todd was asking Sanders about in the first place even higherEmail from Warren Gunnels policy director of Bernie
