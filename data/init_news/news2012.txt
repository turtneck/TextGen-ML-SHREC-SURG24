For political observers 2016 feels like an earthquake  a onceinageneration event that will remake American politics The Republican party is fracturing around support for Donald Trump An avowed socialist has made an insurgent challenge for the Democratic Partys nomination On left and right it feels as though a new era is beginningAnd a new era is beginning but not in the way most people think Though this election feels like the beginning of a partisan realignment its actually the end of one The partisan coalitions that defined the Democratic and Republican parties for decades in the middle of the twentieth century broke apart long ago over the past half century their component voting blocs  ideological demographic economic geographic cultural  have reshuffled The reassembling of new Democratic and Republican coalitions is nearly finishedWhat were seeing this year is the beginning of a policy realignment when those new partisan coalitions decide which ideas and beliefs they stand for  when in essence the party platforms catch up to the shift in party voters that has already happened The type of conservatism long championed by the Republican Party was destined to fall as soon as a candidate came along who could rally its voters without being beholden to its donors experts and pundits The future is being built before our eyes with farreaching consequences for every facet of American politicsThe 2016 race is a sign that American politics is changing in profound and lasting ways by the 2020s and 2030s partisan platforms will have changed drastically You may find yourself voting for a party you could never imagine supporting right now What will that political future look likeTodays Republican Party is predominantly a Midwestern white workingclass party with its geographic epicenter in the South and interior West Todays Democratic Party is a coalition of relatively upscale whites with racial and ethnic minorities concentrated in an archipelago of densely populated blue citiesIn both parties theres a gap between the inherited orthodoxy of a decade or two ago and the real interests of todays electoral coalition And in both parties that gap between voters and policies is being closed in favor of the voters  a slight transition in the case of Hillary Clinton but a dramatic one in the case of Donald TrumpDuring the Democratic primary pundits who focused on the clash between Clinton and Sanders missed a story that illuminated this shift The failure of Jim Webbs brief campaign for the presidential nomination Webb was the only candidate who represented the oldstyle Democratic Party of the mid20th century  the party whose central appeal was among white Southerners and Northern white ethnics Even during the New Democrat era of Bill Clinton white workingclass remnants of that coalition were still important in the party But by 2016 Webb lacked a constituency and he was out of place among the politicians seeking the Democratic presidential nomination which included one lifelong socialist Bernie Sanders and two candidates who had been raised as Republicans Hillary Clinton and briefly Lincoln ChafeeOn the Republican side the exemplary living fossil was Jeb Bush Like his brother Jeb pushed a neoReaganite synthesis of support for a hawkish foreign policy social conservatism and cuts in middleclass entitlements to finance further tax cuts for the rich From the Reagan era until recently the GOPs economic policies have been formulated by libertarians whose views are at odds with those of most Republican voters In March of this year a Pew Research Center poll showed that 68 percent of Republicans and Republicanleaning voters opposed future reductions in Social Security benefits  almost the same amount of support found among Democrats and Demleaning voters 73 percent Republicans who supported Trump were even more opposed to Social Security benefit cuts at 73 percent And even among those who supported Kasich 62 percent opposed cuts in Social Security benefits  even though Kasich himself is in favor of cutting entitlementsAs countryandwestern Republicans have gradually replaced countryclub Republicans the gap between the partys economic orthodoxy and the economic interests of white workingclass voters in the GOP base has increased House Republicans repeatedly have passed versions of Paul Ryans budget plan which is based on cutting Social Security and replacing Medicare with vouchersExcept for Trump all of the leading Republican candidatesCruz Bush Rubio Kasichfavored some version of the Ryan agenda By contrast Trump was the only leading GOP candidate who expressed the actual preference of most Republican voters declaring his absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is Not increase the age and leave it as is Trump is now the presumptive Republican presidential nomineeIf Trump is defeated what is left of the GOP establishment might try to effect a restoration of the old economic dogma of free trade mass immigration and entitlement cuts But sooner or later a Republican Party platform with policies that most of the partys core voters reject will be revised or abandonedover the objections of libertarian Republican party donors and allied think tanks and magazines if necessaryWhy is this all happening now Because the decadeslong culture war between religious conservatives and secular liberals is largely overMost culturewar conflicts involve sexuality gender or reproduction for example abortion contraception LGBT rights and samesex marriage The centrality of culturewar issues in national politics from the 1960s to the present allowed both major parties to contain factions with incompatible economic views For a generation the Democratic Party has included both free traders and protectionists  but support for abortion rights and more recently gay rights have been litmus tests for Democratic politicians with national ambitions Conversely Republicans have been allowed to disagree about trade and immigration but all Republican presidential candidates have had to pay lip service to repealing Roe v Wade and outlawing abortionSocial issues spurred a partisan realignment by changing who considered themselves Democrats and Republicans Over decades socially conservative workingclass whites migrated from the Democratic Party to join the Republican Party especially in the South Socially moderate Republicans especially on the East Coast shifted to the Democratic coalition Now theres little disagreement within each party on social issues Liberal Republicans are as rare as Reagan DemocratsLike an ebb tide that reveals a reshaped coastline the culture war remade the parties membership and is now receding In its absence we are able to see a transformed political landscapeThe culture war and partisan realignment are over the policy realignment and border war  a clash between nationalists mostly on the right and multicultural globalists mostly on the left  have just begunFor the nationalists the most important dividing line is that between American citizens and everyone elsesymbolized by Trumps proposal for a Mexican border wall On the right American nationalism is tainted by strains of white racial and religious nationalism and nativism reinforced by Trumps incendiary language about Mexicans and his proposed temporary ban on Muslims entering the USBut while there is overlap between nationalists and racists the two are not the same thing The most extreme white nationalists dont advocate nationalism as a governing philosophy in our multiracial country they hope to withdraw from American life and create a white homeland within the nationstate Nationalism is different than white nationalism and a populist American nationalism untainted by vestiges of racial bigotry might have transracial appeal like versions of national populism in Latin AmericaThe rise of populist nationalism on the right is paralleled by the rise of multicultural globalism on the centerleftFor multicultural globalists national boundaries are increasingly obsolete and perhaps even immoral According to the emerging progressive orthodoxy the identities that count are subnational race gender orientation and supranational citizenship of the world While not necessarily representative of Democratic voters progressive pundits and journalists increasingly speak a dialect of ethical cosmopolitanism or globalism  the idea that it is unjust to discriminate in favor of ones fellow nationals against citizens of foreign countriesThis difference in worldviews maps neatly into differences in policy Nationalists support immigration and trade deals only if they improve the living standards of citizens of the nation For the new globally minded progressives the mere wellbeing of American workers is not a good enough reason to oppose immigration or trade liberalization Its an argument that todays progressive globalists have borrowed from libertarians immigration or trade that depresses the wages of Americans is still justified if it makes immigrants or foreign workers better offThe disagreements within both parties on trade is a living example of the inchoate policy realignment Every major Republican presidential candidate supported freetrade agreements  with the sole and major exception of Donald Trump the presumptive nominee who routinely slams freetrade deals and has called for the reintroduction of certain tariffs on foreign goodsLikewise the current opposition of many Democratic politicians to freetrade agreements like the TransPacific Partnership reflects the residual influence of declining manufacturing unions within the party According to a March 2016 study by the Pew Research Center by a margin of 56 percent to 38 percent Democratic voters believe that freetrade agreements have been good for the US Among Republicans those numbers are almost reversed by a 53 percent to 38 percent margin a majority of Republicans believe freetrade has been a bad thing Among younger Americans who tend to prefer Democrats to Republicans support for free trade is high 67 percent of 18 to 29yearolds say trade agreements are good for the country Even progressives who campaign against trade deals feel obliged by the logic of ethical cosmopolitanism to justify their opposition in the name of the labor rights of foreign workers or the good of the global environmentFor the next decade or longer as the parties stances adjust this border war that has succeeded the culture war will define and remake American politicsThe outlines of the twoparty system of the 2020s and 2030s are dimly visible The Republicans will be a party of mostly workingclass whites based in the South and West and suburbs and exurbs everywhere They will favor universal contributory social insurance systems that benefit them and their families and reward work effortprograms like Social Security and Medicare But they will tend to oppose meanstested programs for the poor whose benefits they and their families cannot enjoyThey will oppose increases in both legal and illegal immigration in some cases because of ethnic prejudice in other cases for fear of economic competition The instinctive economic nationalism of tomorrows Republicans could be invoked to justify strategic trade as well as crude protectionism They are likely to share Trumps view of unproductive finance The hedgefund guys didnt build this country These are guys that shift paper around and they get luckyThe Democrats of the next generation will be even more of an alliance of upscale progressive whites with blacks and Latinos based in large and diverse cities They will think of the US as a version of their multicultural coalition of distinct racial and ethnic identity groups writ large Many younger progressives will take it for granted that moral people are citizens of the world equating nationalism and patriotism with racism and fascismThe witheringaway of industrial unions thanks to automation as well as offshoring will liberate the Democrats to embrace free trade along with mass immigration wholeheartedly The emerging progressive ideology of postnational cosmopolitanism will fit nicely with urban economies which depend on finance tech and other industries of global scope and which benefit from a constant stream of immigrants both skilled and unskilledWhile tomorrows Republican policymakers will embrace FDRtoLBJ universal entitlements like Social Security and Medicare future Democrats may prefer meanstested programs for the poor only In the expensive hierarchical cities in which Democrats will be clustered universal social insurance will make no sense Payroll taxes on urban workers will be too low to fund universal social insurance while universal social benefits will be too low to matter to the urban rich So the welltodo in expensive unequal Democratic cities will agree to moderately redistributive taxes which pay for meanstested benefitsperhaps even a guaranteed basic incomefor the disproportionately poor and foreignborn urban workforce As populist labor liberalism declines within the Democratic party employerfriendly and financefriendly libertarianism will grow The Democrats of 2030 may be more promarket than the RepublicansOf the two coalitions which is likely to prevail most of the timeWhile progressives claim that nonwhite Americans will become a majority this is misleading for two reasons To begin with according to the Census Bureau from this point until 2060 there will be only limited growth in the AfricanAmerican population a rise from 132 percent to 143 percent and the AsianAmerican population 54 percent to 93 percent as shares of the whole The growth of the nonwhite category by 2060 is driven overwhelmingly by the increasing Latino share of the population from 174 percent to 286 percentSecond Latino Americans increasingly identify themselves as white Between the 2000 Census and the 2010 Census about 7 percent of Hispanics changed their selfdescription from some other race to white At the same time according to the Census Bureau threefourths of white population growth in 21stcentury America has been driven by individuals who declared themselves white and of Hispanic origin If increasing numbers of Hispanics identify as white and their descendants are defined as white in government statistics there may be a white majority in the US throughout the 21st centuryMore important than unscientific Census classifications will be how the growing Latino population votes Trumps unpopularity among Latino voters is likely to help the Democrats in the short run But Democrats cannot assume theyll have a solid Latino voting bloc in the future In Texas in particular Republicans have been successful in winning many Latino voters all the way back to Senator John Tower and Governor George W Bush In Texas 2014 elections Republican gubernatorial nominee Greg Abbott won 44 percent of Latino Texans Republican US Senator John Cornyn did even better with 48 percentIn the coming decades it is possible that Latinos will be reliable Democratic voters and condemn the Republican Party to minority status at the presidential level if not everywhere But it is also possible that as Latinos assimilate and intermarry they will move from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party following a trail blazed in the past by many white ethnic voters of European descent including IrishAmericans and ItalianAmericansThe policy realignment of the present and near future will complete the partisan realignment of the past few decades And though its impossible to know exactly how it will end one thing is clear In 2016 the old political system is crumbling and a new American political order is being born
