Tesla Worlds Safest Car Explodes Like a Bomb By DailyBellStaff  November 05 2016 Fiery Tesla Crash Sends Flaming Batteries Shooting Like Projectiles Killing Two In Worlds Safest Car  When a Tesla Model S collided with a tree in downtown Indianapolis Thursday an inferno erupted The crash which killed the driver and her one passenger sent battery cells firing off almost like projectiles around rescuers fire department officials told local NBC affiliate WTHR It hit that tree and it bounced around and all of a sudden it just exploded Al Finnell an eyewitness told the station IBD The worlds safest car just blew up like a bomb but that message seems to be getting lost amidst the larger coverage about Tesla For years and years Tesla has never made a nickel despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars But the company is beloved by the predictable monetary elites that seek more and more control over the rest of us Founder Elon Musk offers that potential control Every day he works as hard as he can to ensure that sooner or later government will take away your ability to drive where you want when you want Here at DB weve written several articles about Tesla  here and here  most recently We dont like the car and much more than that we dont like the implications behind it Elon Musk CEO of Tesla is fairly clear about his goals He wants to create an electric selfdriving car And he has Tesla fans throughout the US and the world Extend the logic and you come the inevitable conclusion that larger entities will have to support Teslas vision These entities will surely be linked to some sort of government control Dont pay your ticket Have a confrontation of some sort outside of the home Or simply fall afoul of one of a plethora of rules and regulations that increasingly hemin behavior  and you will pay the consequences in terms of your driving life You will get up in the morning and your car wont start because someone has flagged your behavior If you do manage to get your car started it wont go anywhere because its driving mechanisms have been disabled Youll have to go to court Youll have to pay a fine Then youll be able to drive again Or maybe not Think driving is a privilege Just wait We could extend this logic beyond government Its perfectly possible that large private entities could have relationships with government that generate similar consequences Why Musk has managed to attract fans for his cars given the inevitable results of his technology is a mystery to us His ability to continue to fund his endless automotive depredations are a mystery as well It is most probable that his access to funds has a lot to do with the maturation of his technology and the increasing governmental control it offers We live in a time when technology is being celebrated as an enabler of freedom but it the kinds of technology that Musk is perfecting has little to do with freedom No doubt it could but not in the current climate There are other issues as well Musk is running a vast corporation with other peoples money But if you look elsewhere you will see other titanic entities are throwing their resources behind the development of technology especially robots It would be one thing if these technological innovations were being developed by entrepreneurs But one of the biggest developer of robot technology  deadly technology at that  is the Pentagon Since weve already seen movies about deadly robots were not shocked by the idea of what the Pentagon is doing But that doesnt make it much better How many people wake up in the morning and decide theyre going to build a robot that will kill people automatically But thats what is going on This technology is being developed by huge corporations with virtually unlimited funds These corporations wouldnt exist without monopoly central banking and a variety of rules and regulations to support them and ensure they have little or no competition The world today is technocratic and fascist It is run by gigantic corporations that would not exist without laws and judicial decisions that guarantee their viability no matter how incompetently they operate These corporations work handinglove with governments around the world Both the corporations and governments are run secretly by the same banking cabal that runs central banking via the Bank for International Settlements in Switzerland In other words the technological progress that we are supposed to celebrate is actually being organized for nefarious purposes It wouldnt exist in the form it does without vast entities that have turned their energies toward perfecting technology that is intended to create additional control not freedom A normal entrepreneurial society in which individuals and groups applied technology with an eye toward marketplace acceptance might end up with completely different kinds of technology Many people might reject selfdriving cars and killer robots  at least without proper safeguards But we dont have normal societies in the world for the most part Instead we have people like Elon Musk who builds the worlds safest car albeit one that explodes like a bomb at high impact More The impact knocked the wheels off of the car before the batteries caught fire and exploded Speckman died at the scene while her passenger 44yearold Kevin McCarthy died at the hospital What else do we learn Lithiumion battery cell fires are tough to put out Indiana Fire Trucks Battalion Chief Kevin Jones said The Tesla Model S is known for being fabulously safe As the article informs us it achieved the highest National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rating of any car ever tested Conclusion Except when it explodes
