From his condemnation of journalists to his racially tinged attacks on a judge presiding over a lawsuit related to Trump University to his feud with New Mexico GOP Gov Susana Martinez theres one thing in common about the mounting Trump controversies The presumptive Republican presidential nominee is aiming to make the entire 2016 campaign about himselfAmerican politics is littered with largerthanlife personalities But no presidential candidate in living memory has built a campaign so exclusively on the foundation of his own personal brand selfcongratulatory rhetoric and life story as Trump And dont expect anything different if he makes it to the White HouseYou think Im going to change he told reporters at a press conference this week Im not going to changeTrump has prospered by being the loudest most unapologetic salesman of self in politics that most seasoned observers have ever seen He is not just the figurehead of his own campaign  his personality is the campaign as evidenced by stump speeches press conferences and endless television and radio interviews that add up to an unstoppable torrent of selfpromotionThe Trump campaign is not about any cause it is all about Trump said Peter Wehner who has watched candidates and presidents up close as an aide in the last three Republican administrations His campaign is all about him How he treats other people is all about him  whether one is praised and patted on the head or cruelly mocked depends on what you have said about himTrumps selfaggrandizement has become a dominant theme of the presidential campaignThe billionaire boasts about his wealth his portfolio of gleaming buildings and golf resorts soaring poll numbers the size of his crowds his crazy television ratings how Mexicans will love him how his book is an all time bestseller and how his 757 jet is superior to Air Force OneIts an egodriven strategy that would doom most politiciansBut so far Trumps unique personal and unconventional campaign style has worked Hes dispatched his rivals in a bloated Republican field and is now locked in a tight general election duel with Hillary Clinton His style could even help him win over disaffected workers who also seem themselves as victimized by the political and economic establishmentStill there are major questions about whether a personalitydriven campaign  lacking the traditional organizational and field skills  can be successful during a complex national contestThe Clinton campaign is working overtime to make Trumps personal mythologizing look like a fatal flaw The former secretary of state is mounting a twopronged strategy that centers directly on Trumps persona She hopes to make a case that his volatile personality makes him unsuitable to be commanderinchief and to use incidents from his colorful character and business career to deconstruct Trumps carefully built self imageTrumps allies dismiss the idea that his campaign style lacks the gravitas and temperament required of a President arguing that his tirades against the press for instance are merely a result of unfair coverageMany of the reporters know the facts but choose to write horrible stories about him or portray him in a negative light Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson told CNNs New Day on Wednesday adding that if Trump becomes President he will have wide public support So its not going to get to the point of a temperament question because the people will be behind Mr TrumpTrump is hardly alone in getting high on himself Selfconfidence is synonymous with politicsBut presidential candidates typically take pains to mask their personal ambition in a flurry of detailed policy positions and ostentatious attempts to feel the voters painPeter Feaver a former aide to President George W Bush said Trumps reliance on his personality is uniqueThis persona is actually one he has been honing for decades said Feaver a former senior National Security Council official noting that unlike other big personalities that took aim at the presidency Trump lacked core ideological convictionsTake Ronald Reagan for instance He clearly had a persona that was built up over decades but even more he had a governing philosophy even as he was developing a persona Fever said Trump doesnt have that He just has the personaFeaver also notes the irony that after spending eight years lambasting President Barack Obama as a hubristic selfobsessed figure Republicans are about to nominate someone who takes those perceived deficiencies to extremesThe presumptive GOP nominee is not known for introspection But he seems to agree with critics who say the campaign is almost exclusively about himselfA very good musician said Trump is the greatest in the world without a guitar meaning without an instrument Ive got to stand up here by myself Trump said in California last week explaining his unique style of political performance artHe want on to boast how a good friend  who was by the way one of the most successful people in the country in the world  asked him how he was able to hold such large audiences in the palm of his handI said You know honestly its not hard because theres so much love in the room Its unbelievableSuch comments laced throughout Trumps public appearances reveal a politician apparently intoxicated with his own magnetism and brimming with self beliefAnd they contrast with the stump speeches of more conventional political nominees  which sag with policies designed to lure various constituencies of a party and cliched invocations to a higher national purpose and political unity that Trumps speeches conspicuously lackHis public appearances while hitting top political points on illegal immigration free trade and US allies who he says are fleecing America are effectively a list of his personal triumphs  that seem like the obsessions of a billionaire and have little in common with his heartland audiencesHe frequently relates the tale of his new hotel in Washington in the citys old Post Office building which he says will come in under budget and ahead of schedule and will be a higherquality hotel than anybody ever saw before And he often recalls the media frenzy as he and his wife Melania descended the escalator at Trump tower to launch his campaign last year saying it looked literally like the Academy AwardsTrumps implicit case is that his personality is so dominant his presence alone makes the need for detailed policy proposals moot Thats why when he vows to rescue health care for veterans he doesnt say how he will get it done He promises to bring back jobs from Mexico and China  again without revealing his approach He says he will knock the hell out of ISIS but doesnt detail a credible military strategyGiven the billionaires somewhat ill defined political creed and unpredictable style no one can say for sure what his presidency would be likeBut if the campaign is anything to go by one thing is certain it would be all about Trump
