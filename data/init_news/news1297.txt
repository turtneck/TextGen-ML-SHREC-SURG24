With Marco Rubio dropping out of the Republican presidential race Tuesday the Florida senator leaves a large cache of delegates behind So what happens to them and the delegates of other former candidates at the convention in ClevelandThe short answer is It varies from state to state but the Republican Party leaves enough wiggle room that the delegates of former candidates could end up being a factor in JulyAn unbound delegate is worth their weight in gold Rick Wilson a GOP strategist told FoxNewscom Its hard to speculate and theres a lot going on right nowRubio in suspending his campaign after his homestate Florida loss leaves 169 delegates behind Ben Carson accrued eight delegates before he dropped out of the race while Jeb Bush picked up four Carly Fiorina Mike Huckabee and Rand Paul each picked up one in IowaAnd if either Ted Cruz or John Kasich drop out in the weeks ahead  and Donald Trump still has not clinched the nomination with the necessary 1237 delegates  additional zombie delegates could be in play in ClevelandAnd they could hold swayThats because in most states delegates become unbound and are free to support other contenders as soon as their candidate withdrawsThey dont necessarily have to gravitate toward the frontrunner at a contested convention or in the case of Rubios delegates the candidate the Florida senator may ultimately choose to endorseThey would become essentially free agents prizes to be wooed by the candidates duking it out in ClevelandHowever some states bind their delegates to the first ballot no matter whatIn Tennessee delegates are bound for two rounds of voting while in Iowa Texas Virginia Montana Nevada Puerto Rico and Washington candidates are bound for at least one round of voting whether or not the candidate has withdrawnIn South Carolina delegates are bound to the candidate for the first ballot However if the winner is not nominated they are bound to the candidate who finished second or third in the stateThe various state laws mean that while some of the delegates can already peel off to other candidates many would have to wait until after a first ballot in order to be able to vote for another candidate still in the raceIt remains unclear whether frontrunner Trump might be able to reach 1237 delegates before the convention and avoid this drama He currently has 661 Ted Cruz has 406 and John Kasich has 142Those such as Kasich who are banking on the prospect of a contested convention where the delegates of excandidates and other factors could be in play see a blueprint in past races dating back decadesSince 1880 there have been eight contested GOP conventions and in five of those the eventual winner did not go into the convention with a plurality of delegatesIn the 1976 Republican convention it was the unbound delegates moving toward President Gerald Ford instead of Ronald Reagan that handed Ford the nomination that year Ford held a slight lead going into the convention but was shy of an outright majorityIn part by using the power of the White House with promises of visits and patronage to woo over delegates Ford won the nomination on the first ballot by a slim 60 votes
