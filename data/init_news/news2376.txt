declined to comment Tuesday evening David E Kendall Clintons lawyer did not immediately return messages seeking commentA senior Clinton campaign aide said the server hadnt yet changed hands as of Tuesday evening and Clintons team is working with the Justice Department to arrange the logistics of the handover The thumb drive meanwhile has been turned over And Kendall the aide said has followed State Department guidance on safekeepingClintons campaign believes there are no emails from her State Department tenure on the server since it was wiped clean after she turned over her workrelated emails to the State Department the aide saidThe aide said its the Clinton campaigns understanding that the Justice Department isnt looking to reconstruct the servers history but is instead concerned about the security of the emails today since some are now classified though they werent classified or labeled as such at the timeFor Clinton the move  which Republicans like House Speaker John Boehner have urged for months  indicates her campaign sees a growing risk in the issue of her use of a private email server which has stoked concerns about her trustworthinessIts about time Boehner said in a statement Tuesday nightSince news broke in March of her use of a personal email address on a server kept in her Chappaqua New York home Clinton has insisted that shes turned over all of her workrelated emails to the State Department and deleted all others  but wouldnt turn over her server to the governmentClinton has been dogged by poll numbers showing that more Americans by a margin of about 20 percentage points say shes not trustworthy rather than trustworthy A late July CNNORC poll found that 58 of all registered voters say it is extremely important that the next president be honest and trustworthyRep Trey Gowdy who chairs the House Select Committee on Benghazi and has pushed for Clintons emails for months claimed credit for her decision to turn over the serverThe revelation that Secretary Clinton exclusively used private email for official public business and the multitude of issues that emanated from her decision including this most recent one demonstrates what can happen when Congress and those equally committed to exposing the truth doggedly pursue facts and follow them he said in a statementSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley RIowa said Clinton waited a long time before turning the server overThats a long time for top secret classified information to be held by an unauthorized person outside of an approved secure government facility he said in a statement I look forward to the FBI answering my questions so the American people can be assured that everything has been done to protect our national security interests and hold accountable anyone who broke the rulesStill its clear the GOP wont stop hitting Clinton on the campaign trail accusing her of secrecy over her decision to wait five months to turn over the serverRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement Tuesday night that releasing the server does little to answer questions about Clintons honestyIf Hillary Clinton believed in honesty and transparency she would have turned over her secret server months ago to an independent arbiter not as a last resort and to the Obama Justice Department he said Of course if she really cares about transparency she would never have had a secret server in the first placeClintons decision to hand over the server comes as the intelligence communitys inspector general now says at least five emails stored on Clintons server contained classified information The documents were from a limited sampling of her emails and among those 40 reviewed said the inspector general Charles McCullough IIIOn Tuesday McCullough sent four of the emails to chairs of several congressional committees In a cover letter he said two of the four emails included information that has now been classified up to top secretOne of the five emails has since been declassified because it was no longer timesensitive The intelligence community maintains the remaining two contained classified material but is deferring to the State Department on whether they should be identified as suchMcCullough said in the past that none of the emails we reviewed had classification or dissemination markings but that some should have been handled as classified appropriately marked and transmitted via a secure network The State Department has told McCullough that there are potentially hundreds of classified emails within the approximately 30000 provided by former Secretary ClintonRepublicans shared exclusively with CNN Tuesday a review of those emails that the State Department had released which they said showed Clinton and her aides sent information that would later be classified to six peoples private email addresses They include former Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns Cheryl Mills who was Clintons chief of staff at the State Department and Jake Sullivan who served as Clintons top foreign policy adviser Clinton also emailed information that would later be classified to close confidant Sidney Blumenthal whose communications with Clinton about Libya have become a focus of the House committee investigating the 2012 Benghazi attacksThe fact that classified information was sent to and from Hillary Clinton to at least six separate individuals and potentially many more demonstrates just how big of a risk her decision to use a secret server poses to our national security Republican National Committee research director Raj Shah told CNNThe probe into Clintons email practices has now expanded to include some of her top aides as part of a larger investigation on the use of private email accounts by previous secretaries of state The Republican chairmen of three Senate committees  intelligence homeland security and foreign relations  sent a joint request in March for both inspectors general to investigate the personal emails of Clintons aidesWe will follow the facts wherever they lead to include former aides and associates as appropriate said Douglas Welty a spokesman for the State Departments inspector generalIn a July 17 letter to the State Department Steve A Linick the State Department inspector general said his office is reviewing the use of personal communications hardware and software by five secretaries of state and their immediate staffs The Office of the Intelligence Community Inspector General is assisting in the reviewOne of the emails containing sinceclassified information was released to the public prompting the intelligence community to ask the FBI to investigate the possible compromise of classified material The State Department now has a team of analysts from the intelligence community to review Clintons emails before any more are released to the publicOf the two topsecret emails sent to Congress on Tuesday State Department spokesman John Kirby said they have not been released to the public and the department is taking steps to ensure the information is protected and stored appropriately while the determination was madeDepartment employees circulated these emails on unclassified systems in 2009 and 2011 and ultimately some were forwarded to Secretary Clinton Kirby said They were not marked as classified
