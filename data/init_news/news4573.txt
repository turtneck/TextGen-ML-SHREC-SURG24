You can buy snacks condoms fishing bait marijuana and even gold from vending machines so Sam Piccinini figured Why not bulletsA 25year police department veteran who now runs his own ammunition manufacturing and wholesale business Piccinini of Rochester Pa has two of his retrofitted vending machines at his local gun club The machines which sell nearly every caliber of bullet from 22 to 45 are doing a brisk business and Piccinini said other clubs want his machinesI have clubs lining up at my door wanting them Piccinini told FoxNewscom I have five clubs chomping at the bit wanting these machinesPiccinini who owns Master Ammo Co a licensed manufacturer of ammunition said he got the idea two years ago when bullet shortages around the nation left members of the Beaver Valley Rifle  Pistol Club unable to buy the nonjacketed rounds preferred at most shooting rangesFirst Piccinini asked local attorney Eugene Martucci if such a machine would be legal Told such a device could be operated lawfully Piccinini bought a vending machine and had some modifications made to it allowing it to accept larger bills and credit cards and to hoist and dispense bags of 45caliber Automatic Colt Pistol cartridges He figures he spent about 4000 on the first vending machine He now has two of them at the club and a third ready to be deployedPiccininis machines sell both handgun and rifle ammunition which are regulated differently In Pennsylvania people ages 18 and over can buy long gun ammunition and people over 21 can buy bullets for handguns Critics say selling from a machine without an attendant to ensure the purchase is legal poses a problemPiccinini likens his machines to cigarette vending machines in social clubs noting that a prominent sticker on them states You must be 21 years of age to purchase ammunition for use in handguns from this machine Since the club does not admit minors without adult guardians and since anyone entering must pass through a security gate and swipe an ID card to enter Piccinini does not believe there is a risk of illicit salesIts not like someone walking off the street can get in and buy ammunition Piccinini saidSelling bullets out of a vending machine as opposed to over a counter is not a big deal said Ladd Everitt spokesman for the Washingtonbased progun control group Coalition to Stop Gun ViolenceAmmunition is widely available at ranges to begin withand we dont take issue with that Everitt said If they put it in a school call me backThe federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives regulates sales of ammunition and Piccinini has permits allowing him to manufacture sell and even export guns and ammunition Stephen Bartholomew of the BATFEs Philadelphia field office told the BeaverCountiancom he had never come across vending machines that sell ammunitionI dont want to speculate as to what is or is not happening in this particular situation but a licensee cannot sell ammunition to anyone under the age of 18 and importantly you cannot sell handgun ammunition to individuals under the age of 21 he saidThe club makes no money off of sales or for renting space for the machines which Piccinini who sells ammunition to retailers and police departments in Pennsylvania hopes will become a growing part of his companyThe club doesnt receive any profits and the machines are strictly there for the convenience of its members said PiccininiThe club is not looking for publicity for the machines according to its president Bill FortunaThis has been kept a secret its nobodys business its our club we can do as our members allow us Fortuna told BeaverCountiancom Legally theres nothing anybody can do about itPiccinini who is running for Beaver County sheriff a post he has twice sought unsuccessfully believes criticism he has received for his brainchild will ultimately backfire and win him the votes of Second Amendment advocates in the March 19 Republican primarySome people have been critical but I think even more people support me and support the right to bear arms he said
