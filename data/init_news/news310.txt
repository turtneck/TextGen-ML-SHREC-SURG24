thefirst test of whether Trump can turn the legion of fans drawn to his plainspoken populism into voters The scope of the billionaires organization in Iowa is a mystery though Trump himself has intensified his campaign schedule during the final sprint including a pair of rallies Monday  I dont have to win it Trump said on CBS Face the Nation Sunday Im doing really well with the evangelicals
