WASHINGTON  President Obama said Sunday that his administration will walk away from negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program unless the United States can verify that Iran is not developing nuclear weaponsIf we cannot verify that they are not going to obtain a nuclear weapon that theres a breakout period so that even if they cheated we would be able to have enough time to take action  if we dont have that kind of deal then were not going to take it the president said in an interview onCBS Face the NationIf theres no deal Obama said then we walk awayThe United States and its allies have until March 24 to reach an agreement with Iran Obama wants to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons while still allowing the country to enrich uranium to use for energy productionOver the next month or so were going to be able to determine whether or not their system is able to accept what would be an extraordinarily reasonable deal if in fact as they say they are only interested in peaceful nuclear programs Obama told correspondent Bill Plante And if we have unprecedented transparency in that system if we are able to verify that in fact they are not developing weapons systems then theres a deal to be had but thats going to require them to accept the kind of verification and constraints on their program that so far at least they have not been willing to say yes toHe said talks with Iran which have been going on for more than a year have not cost the United States anything Iran has been abiding by an interim agreement not to advance its nuclear program the president saidWere not losing anything through these talks Obama saidIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also appearing on Face the Nation said he and Obama have the same ultimate goal in trying to ensure that Iran doest develop nuclear weapons But Netanyahu said he doesnt trust that inspections will prevent the Iranians from cheating and developing weaponsI do not trust inspections with totalitarian regimes Netanyahu said What Im suggesting is that you contract Irans nuclear program so theres less to inspectNetanyahu spoke to a joint session of Congress last Tuesday warning US lawmakers against a deal with IranThe Senate must weigh in on whatever deal is reached Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell RKy saidThe Iranians are fomenting trouble in Syria in Lebanon in Gaza in Yemen McConnell said on Face the Nation All over the Middle East theyre on the march Theyve had enhanced influence in Iraq We cant ignore all of their other behavior in looking at the potential nuclear deal What we do know about the deal is it looks like it will leave the nuclear infrastructure in place with one of the worst regimes in the worldMcConnell said he is working to put together a vetoproof majority to support a measure giving Congress the authority to approve or disapprove of any dealSen Chuck Schumer DNY agreed that Congress has a role in whatever deal may be reachedCongress passed the sanctions itself so Congress has very much an interest in the sanctions Schumer said in a separate Face the Nation interview I pushed that it shouldnt be done before theres an agreementbut after that yes Congress has a right to weigh in and I support it
