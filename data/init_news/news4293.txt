Sinjar Iraq CNN Plumes of smoke blackened the sky above Sinjar as Kurdish forces backed by intense coalition air support tried Thursday to take back the northern Iraqi town from ISIS The operation includes up to 7500 Peshmergas  the Kurdish military force  who are attacking the city from three sides to take control of supply routes according to the Kurdish Region Security CouncilCNN senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh is with one of the three fronts of fighters who launched their liberation operation early Thursday morning against a backdrop of airstrikesThe USbacked coalition Operation Inherent Resolve said coalition aircraft have conducted more than 250 airstrikes across northern Iraq in the last month The strikes have reportedly destroyed ISIS fighting positions command and control facilities weapon storage facilities improvised explosive device factories and staging areasA pitchblack sky was lit up by a lot of coalition airstrikes following days of bombing At dawn a large procession of Peshmerga started snaking their way through Sinjar mountain and behind it Paton Walsh saidThe coalition strikes were pounding the strategic city itself he said with four different columns of smoke darkening the horizon above The strikes on Sinjar almost make the sky over it look black Theres a vast amount of air power  more intense than the fight for KobaniAccording to a Pentagon spokesman US troops are in the field calling in airstrikes from positions in SinjarThe Peshmerga forces are carrying this out with as you said the support of coalition advisers There are US personnel My understanding is there are coalition advisers from other countries as well participating Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told reportersHe added Most of those folks as I understand it are behind the front lines advising and working directly with Peshmerga commanders There are some advisers who are on Sinjar mountain assisting in the selection of airstrike targetsLate Thursday the Kurdish Region Security Council released a statement detailing the days operations It reported that more than 150 square kilometers 60 square miles had been retaken from ISISPeshmerga units will continue from three fronts to set up defensive positions allowing engineering teams to clear the heavily mined area Peshmerga forces have already achieved two of three strategic goals dealing a significant blow to ISIL morals it read using an alternative acronym for ISIS The final objective  to enter and clear the city  will be underway soonReclaiming Sinjar is one big step toward dividing the caliphate that ISIS claims it is establishing across the regionThe artery that passes through the town links the Iraqi city of Mosul  ISIS prized possession  with cities it holds in SyriaPaton Walsh said the highway was a key goal for the Kurdish fighters who were equipped with vehicles ranging from pickup trucks to armored HumveesOne of the targets of this offensive is the highway that runs through Sinjar known as Route No 47 to many Now thats very important not only of course because of what it does to liberate the population of Sinjar  those whove not fled ISIS rule having endured it now for over a year  but also because it is a vital supply route towards Mosul another key target of any future coalition offensive he saidAbout 15 million people still live in Mosul where prices are rising and activists report hungerThe USbacked coalition said Operation Free Sinjar was aimed at clearing ISIS from Sinjar and seizing portions of Highway 47By controlling Highway 47 which is used by Daish to transport weapons fighters illicit oil and other commodities that fund their operations the Coalition intends to increase pressure on Daish and isolate their components from each other it said in a statement Daish is the Arabic acronym for ISISThis operation will degrade Daishs resupply efforts disrupt funding to the terrorist groups operations stem the flow of Daish fighters into Iraq and further isolate Mosul from Ar Raqqah said coalition spokesman Col Christopher C Garver The Syrian city of Ar Raqqah also spelled Raqqa is ISIS de facto capitalBy Thursday afternoon the Kurdish fighters pushing toward Sinjar had taken control of a number of villages near the Iraqi townAlong that highway theres one village Kabara thats been repeatedly hammered by airstrikes in the past hour or so and a lot of Kurdish forces have managed to move into the main road Paton Walsh said Tweets by Kurdish fighters showed that almost all the vehicles in the village had been burned to a crispBefore the push to retake Sinjar began Kurdish fighters said they knew it wouldnt be easyPeshmerga commanders estimate some 600 ISIS fighters are inside Sinjar with recent reinforcements boosting the militants numbers The Kurdish fighters believe they will encounter hundreds of landmines and booby trapsPaton Walsh said it was unclear how ISIS would respond to the offensiveAs youve seen in the past sometimes ISIS have decided that certain fights are not worth them staying for the long haul and I think there is a certain amount of manpower and mass here  and also coalition air power which we heard from the top of Mount Sinjar during a very dark cold night yesterday pound targets consistently around that particular cityPaton Walsh said there had been a substantial uptick in airstrikes on Sinjar in the days leading up to the launch of the offensiveSpeaking to CNNs Fareed Zakaria US Secretary of State John Kerry said hes confident Sinjar will fall but was reluctant to say whenBut I am convinced that Sinjar will be liberated as we have liberated Tikrit And currently the Iraqi forces are moving on Ramadi he saidPresident Obama at the very beginning said were going to degrade and defeat ISIL Were going to stabilize the countries in the region  Jordan Lebanon work with Turkey  and we are going to seek a political settlement he said That is exactly the strategy today and it is working  to a degree  not as fast as we would like perhaps but we are making gainsI think the issue will be for ISIS given the nature of the offensive  from three different directions  quite what their best strategy is to sit here and try and symbolically hold it as long as they can or pull out Paton Walsh saidISIS of course may also be feeling pressure on other fronts Theres been a lot of talk about the possibility of a move against Ramadi for the past few monthsWeve not seen any evidence of that at this particular stage but there is a genuine feeling that maybe the coalition  after months of paralysis months of calm  might also slowly be beginning to get some kind of harmony or synchronicity here in terms of moving on separate fronts against ISIS and perhaps stretching what resources they have a little bit thinnerA coalition spokesman in Baghdad told reporters later Thursday that Iraqi security forces had begun to encircle Ramadi with support from coalition air powerISIS fighters swept into Ramadi in May tightening control of Iraqs Anbar province and gaining a base of operations about 110 kilometers 70 miles away from the capital BaghdadPaton Walsh said the operation to retake Sinjar was important symbolicallyThe Peshmerga here want to show that they can be united with coalition air power with Western military advisers who we understand are in their midst here as well to launch a successful  and they hope brief  offensive towards this town but also strategically because of what Sinjar could mean in the future down the lineHe said the Kurdish fighters appeared optimistic they would take back SinjarI think the hope amongst the Peshmerga and the coalition is that the level of manpower they have here their dominance in the skies means potentially this could be over in days he said But with a town of this size which had tens of thousands living in it before  which ISIS has had months to prepare for an onslaught against  this could turn out to be trickier than some are hopingRetired Lt Col Rick Francona a CNN military analyst agreed that the fight in Sinjar would be slow goingTheyre going to have to slog through this house by house street by street he said Its going to be very difficultMore than a year under ISISSince then Sinjar has become a chaotic jumble of demolished buildings held by ISIS fightersThere is no reliable estimate as to how many civilians still live inside of Sinjar Paton Walsh saidYou can tell how many seem to have fled from the tents the Yazidis have erected up around Mount Sinjar  even in this bitter cold  still enduring a life here wanting to be near their hometown But that is the key concern obviously in situations like this Many will be fearing that the amount of leadup time has given ISIS adequate ability to ensure the civilian population are in place to assist them in protecting themselvesThe Peshmerga said they wanted to establish a buffer zone to protect the civilian population but it was not entirely clear how that would physically work Paton Walsh saidWith the operation to retake the town looming some 5000 Yazidi fighters were mobilized under the command of the Kurdish Peshmerga Most are farmers a very few have military experienceThe Yazidis are one of the worlds smallest and oldest monotheistic religious minorities Their religion is considered a preIslamic sect that draws from Christianity Judaism and the ancient monotheistic religion of Zoroastrianism In ISIS eyes theyre infidelsThe Yazidis and Kurds have lived side by side for thousands of years and are friendly neighborsThe Kurds are Sunni Muslims who have their own unique language and culture They occupy an autonomous region in northern Iraq but the Kurdish homeland also covers portions of Iran Turkey Armenia and Syria
