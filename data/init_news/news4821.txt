USbacked rebels in Syria appealed to the Obama administration Friday for antiaircraft missiles to defend their positions against relentless Russian airstrikes that have so far mostly targeted the moderate opposition to President Bashar alAssads ruleA joint statement issued by the United States and other Western allies who have collectively aided moderate rebel units urged Russia to stop targeting moderate rebels and to focus its efforts on fighting ISIL the acronym referring to the Islamic StateUS officials indicated that there is no immediate plan to offer additional assistance to the rebel units that have been armed and trained under a covert CIAled program aimed at supporting moderate groups and weakening Assads hold on powerThe covert operation is separate from a muchpublicized Pentagon program to train a force to fight the Islamic State that has so far produced no more than four or five loyal fighters and it is widely credited with having helped rebel advances over the past six months in the areas now being targeted by the RussiansRussian warplanes sustained their bombardment of rebel positions in northern Syria for a third day Friday and for the first time the Defense Ministry in Moscow said the strikes also hit targets in the heart of Islamic State territory in the northcentral Syrian province of RaqqaA Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said two strikes overnight Thursday hit an Islamic State training camp and a command post south of the city of Raqqa expanding the scope of the air campaignBut continued airstrikes Friday suggested that Russias main priority remains the antiAssad rebellion in northern and western Syria which poses a greater threat to the regimes control over Damascus the capital than the forces of the Islamic State concentrated in the far north and east of the countryThe attacks by Russian warplanes on the provinces of Hama Homs and Idlib did not target Daesh said the joint statement by the United States and its allies using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State These military actions constitute a further escalation and will only fuel more extremism and radicalizationThe statement was signed by the governments of the United States France Germany Qatar Saudi Arabia Turkey and the United Kingdom which have collectively participated in the effort to arm and train moderate rebels through joint operations centers in Turkey and JordanOne of the groups that has received weapons and training under the program said its positions in the Hama town of Latamneh were hit by 15 bombs Friday the third and heaviest consecutive day of strikes against the town Although Russian officials have insisted that their attacks are only targeting the Islamic State the alQaeda affiliate Jabhat alNusra or other terrorist organizations no other military group is present in the town according to Capt Mustafa Moarati a spokesman for the Tajamu alIzza rebel brigadeHe said a video released by the Russian Defense Ministry on Thursday purportedly showing the destruction of an Islamic State headquarters in fact was of a command center of the USbacked group The Russians are using Su34 warplanes that are more sophisticated than any in the existing Syrian air force enabling a more accurate delivery of higherordnance missiles than had been the case when Syrian warplanes were bombing he saidThey are doing this for two reasons Firstly because we are friends with the United States and they want to challenge the United States And secondly to vanquish the Free Syrian Army on the ground to show the world that only extremists are fighting Assad and that therefore he should survive Moarati said moments before a huge explosion interrupted the call with himIt was the second Russian strike of the day and the sixth in three days he said later adding that 13 more strikes followed He said his unit has already received TOW antitank missiles from the United States under the covert program Unless it also receives antiaircraft missiles his unit is in danger of being eliminated he saidAt least they could give us antiaircraft missiles he saidThis is Russias air power in SyriaHassan Haj Ali the commander of Suqour alJabal another USbacked group targeted by Russian strikes Thursday said that unless the United States offers help to the rebels it has supported so far there is a risk of further radicalizing rebels who have so far adhered to the moderate demands of the 2011 uprising against Assads rule He said he had not received any response to a request for help from the United States relayed through intermediaries who said they would consult with US leadersWe need one of two things Either a clear policy from the United States to prevent Russia and the regime from bombing Syrians or otherwise they should send us antiaircraft missiles so that we can confront the Russian planes he said speaking from the main front line between rebels and the Islamic State in the northern Aleppo town of MaraeIf they dont help us people will lose trust in our supporters and this will increase extremism he addedA US military official said the request was under consideration Repeated requests by USbacked rebels to be supplied with antiaircraft missiles to be used against Syrian aircraft have been repeatedly refused in the pastIts a complicated question and an even more complicated answer said the official speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter freely Any decisions that we make there are going to be ramifications not just for the United States but also for Washingtons partners in the military coalition against the Islamic State he saidRoth reported from Moscow Missy Ryan in Washington and Sam Rifaie in Beirut
