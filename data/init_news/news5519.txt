A State of the Union address is often difficult to factcheck no matter who is president The speech is a product of many hands and is carefully vetted so major errors of fact are relatively rare But State of the Union addresses often are very political speeches an argument for the presidents policies so context is sometimes missingHere is a guide through some of President Obamas most interestingclaims in the order in which he made them We also checked one claim in the GOP response As is our practice with live events we do not award Pinocchio rankings which are reserved for complete columnsWhile President Obama often has touted what he often calls thelongest streak of privatesector job creation in history the average number of jobs created in this 70month period is significantly lower than under either Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan When you exclude a single month of decline in fact Clinton and Reagan had streaks of 85 and 71 months respectivelyThe low point in jobs was reached in February 2010 and there has indeed been a gain of 136 million nonfarm jobs since then according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data But its worth remembering that in the same period the number of federal state and local government jobs has actually declined by nearly 500000The unemployment rate was 78 percent when Obama took office in 2009 and now it is 5 percent The president says it was cut in half by measuring fromthe high point reached during his presidency 10 percent in October 2009Still even with the massive jobs losses at the start of his presidency Obama can claim that nearly 93 million jobs were added since he took office At this point in George W Bushs presidency the comparable number was 13 million and for Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan the figure was 212 million and 127 million respectivelyThe low point for manufacturing jobs was reached in February 2010 and there has been a gain of 878000 jobs since then But Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that the number of manufacturing jobs is still 230000 fewer than when Obama took office in the depths of the recession  and 14 million fewer than when the recession began in December 2007 Indeed the United States only gained 30000 manufacturing jobs in all of 2015Heres a graph that shows the trend over the last 10 yearsThe improvement in the economy coupled with the spending cuts in the sequester has yielded a significantly lower deficit than just a few years ago The deficit for the fiscal year that ended Sept 30 was 439 billionFor economists raw numbers mean less than the percentage of the gross domestic product and here too there has been an improvement As a percentage of the GDP the deficit in fiscal year 2015 was 25 percent the lowest level since 2007For fiscal year 2009 when Obama took office the deficit was 98 percent of GDP so thats a 75 percent reductionThe president used to say roughly 10 nations when making this comparison but cuts in US defense spending and increases in estimates of Chinese spending appear to have shifted the calculationThe mostly widely cited public source for this claim is theStockholm International Peace Research Institute which tallies public numbers each year SIPRIurges caution in how its data is used saying that attempts to draw conclusions about a countrys level of military capability from its level of military expenditure should be regarded with considerable skepticismThats because raw numbers can be misleading The official Chinese figures are believed to be understated  and it costs China less money to buy the same goods and services as the United StatesA rough calculation of purchasing power parity suggests the correct figure for Chinese defense spending could be double official estimatesThe comparison to China also does not include the fact that because it is not a global power Beijing may actually spend more on its military in the western Pacific than does the United StatesMoreover the United States ranks ninth when military spending is measured as a percentage of the gross domestic product according to the CIA Factbook Percentage of GDP is a good indicator of how a country chooses to use its resources  the top ranks of the list are dominated by oilrich Middle Eastern countries and Israel  but the statistic does not shed much light on the effectiveness of a countrys military So there are also limitations in that comparisonIn lauding his achievements in energy the president made a reference to the dramatic decline in gasoline prices But the White House graphics that accompanied his speech in its posting on Medium included a sentencethat madea claim based on much higher gas pricesThe graphic claimed that Americans will save nearly 8000 at the pump in 2025 thanks to doubling the fuel efficiency of our cars and light trucks But there are two big caveats to that figure which comes from official government estimates of the savings over the lifetime of a car between 2012 and 2025First gasoline was presumed to cost about 342 before taxes so obviously anysavings from fuel efficiency would be significantly reduced if gasoline stays at current 2agallon levels Second the cost of the rules was estimated to amount to 3000 thus reducing the savings to car owners to 5000 even before the impact of lower fuel prices is consideredAccording to the Solar Foundation an independent energy research nonprofitthe median wage for solar designers is about 27 per hour and solar installers earn a median wage of 21 per hour Solar installers hourly median wage was 1924 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics most recent May 2014 figuresWorkersin solar assembly earn 18 per hour These figures are indeedhigher than the median hourly wage for all occupations as of the most recent figures in May 2014 at 1709However the median hourly wage for employees in the mining industry including coal mining is also higher than the median hourly wage for all jobs at 4854The groupreportedin its 2015 Census that the solar workforce is larger than the coal industry and other fossil fuel generation sectors It used Bureau of Labor Statistics figures to compare coal industry employees to solar industry employees as measured through its survey of more than 7600 US businessesAs of October 2015 the coal mining industry had 65000 jobs Per the Solar Foundations 2015 figures there were 119931 people employed in solar installationObamasstatement comes from the Department of Energys website which cites the Solar Foundations wage figures But the source is unclear forthe claim that solar is saving tens of millions of dollars a year on energy bills for Arizona and New York residentsSolar power is indeed growing rapidly in New York and Arizona While theDepartment of Energy appears to attribute the savings figures to the Solar Foundation the claim that solar customers are saving 13 million in Arizona and 11 million in New York every year is not in the nonprofits most recent annual reportIts worth noting that in Arizona there is an ongoing controversy over whether residents truly are getting lower rates on solar energy Energy regulators in the stateare battling utility companies over net metering which is the process through which solar customers get a credit for a certain amount of electricity that they send back to the grid Regulators areworking on a compromise dealthat could result in a costshift for nonsolar customersTexas and Iowa lead the nation in wind power and the cost of wind power surely is lower in those states than in others But this claim overlooks the impact of the federal tax credit that has driven much of the cost of wind power downThe average price of coal and natural gas power 65 per megawatthour is still cheaper than newer sources of energy like wind 80 and solar 107 according to the Dallas Morning NewsIn particular the Production Tax Credit is a crucial subsidy that allows wind energy to compete with energy from fossil fuels This tax credit is the driving force behind negative wind power pricing in Texas according to a 2015 report by the Institute of Political Economy at Utah State University and public policy research organization Strata Texas also provides many statelevel financial incentives for wind power generation Update Supporters of wind power energy notedthis report is backed by wind power critics andsaid itsunfair to criticize the tax credits because fossil fuels have received many more government incentives than renewables over a longer period of time They pointedtoother sources showingwinds costs to be lower than for other electricity sourcesThe Department of Energy estimates that within a decade wind power will become costcompetitive with fossil fuels without a federal tax incentiveThe White House noted that solar and wind energyprices are now becoming competitive with energy from conventional fuel sourcesActually federal government employment has dropped during the Obama administration at one point in 2014 federal employment reached the lowest level since 1966 There has been a slight uptick since then but even so as a percentage of total employment the federal government now has the smallest share since World War IIHeres a graph that shows total federal employment since 1939 The spikes every 10 years reflect temporary hiring for the US Census
