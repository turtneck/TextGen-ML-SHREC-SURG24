for the next year Winter appears to be a time of sleep and relaxing by the fire but for a homesteader there is no such thing If you have cows to milk and chickens to feed then you still have to take care of that Then there are all of the other tasks that you have to do clearing the roof bringing in firewood making impromptu repairs Winter is a great time of the year to make a plan for what you need to do in the spring summer and fall to make your homestead successful Weve put together a calendar of things to do in the winter to help make your homestead successful all year round Check your Stockpile Winter is a great time to check your stockpile for several reasons but the primary reason that were adding it to the calendar is so that you can decide what to plant in the spring If youre running out of green beans but still have a ton of corn you can adjust your crops accordingly Plant more beans and less corn The same thing goes for canned meals and condiments If youve just about eaten all of your beef stew and salsa but still have a ton of chicken soup left adjust accordingly You can also determine whether youre best using your crops Say you had a bumper crop of apples and made pie filling applesauce apple cider vinegar  and apple butter Now youre out of pie filling but still have 32 quarts of applesauce It seems like you may want to adjust how you use your apples next year Make a chart and record your findings so that you can compare to last year and make your adjustments You dont want to use your entire stockpile Its good to have enough for a couple of years but you dont want to can 6 months worth of apple butter and 5 years worth of okra especially two years in a row Concentrate on Your HerbsWinter Crops I dont know about you but I love herbs Theyre great for adding flavor and for using medicinally Since theyre easy to grow inside  you can grow them year round Since youre likely slam busy all summer and fall wait until winter to harvest and store your herbs This is a good time to make your essential oils and medicinal blends  too If you live in a moderate climate you may be able to grow some winter crops such as garlic kale carrots and potatoes

Are your chickens cramped and need a new coup How about the barn  does it need repairs Is the tractor running rough Do you need any new equipment Make a list by month of all these projects that you need to address Plan Your Expenses Now that youve sat down and planned your crops and equipment repairs and made a list of other things that you do then plan how much youre going to need to spend versus when youll need it and when youll have the money to do it Try to project any equipment replacements or repairs that youll need too Remember to allow for any unexpected expenses You dont have to stop with just the next year Do a fiveyear plan then adjust as needed Keep adding a year every winter This will really help keep you on track as long as you actually refer back to the list and follow it as much as possible Make Syrup If you live in an area where you have birch or maple trees late winter is when you can gather the sap from the trees and make your syrup for the year Just FYI its a bit of work to make but its free and you can sell it for a great profit Thats assuming your family doesnt make you keep it Do all of the inhouse repairs Think about those creaky stairs unpainted rooms
