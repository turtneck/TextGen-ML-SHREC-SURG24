As he tries to recover from a series of stumbles ahead of an important primary contest next week in Wisconsin Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump made a surprise appearance in Washington on Thursday and presented himself as the presumptive leader of his partyHe met with his foreign policy advisers huddled with Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and predicted that he would bring harmony to the fractured GOPLooking forward to bringing the Party together  and it will happen Trump wrote on Twitter shortly after his RNC meetingWhen asked about the meeting during an interview with Fox News Trump called the party officials very good people Two days earlier Trump had backed away from an earlier party loyalty pledge and complained about being treated very badly by the GOPHe called Thursdays session aterrific meeting and a unity meeting according to a transcript oftheinterviewTrumps Washington visit came as his efforts to secure the nomination have encountered growing turbulence and the GOP remains in disarrayAntiTrump forces in the party are frantically maneuvering to defeat the New York billionaire in Tuesdays Wisconsin primary which is shaping up as a crucial moment in the battle for the GOP nominationA Trump loss to rival Sen Ted Cruz of Texas would increase the likelihood of a contested convention in July which Trump critics hope could ultimately deny him the nominationIf he loses Wisconsin he would have to completely run the table in the remaining contests and I dont think thats going to happen said Katie Packer director of Our Principles PAC an antiTrump group She was referring to what would be necessary to get the 1237 delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballotUntil recent days Trump appeared to be gaining strength against his GOP opponents amassing delegates rising in the polls and continuing to draw large crowds to his rallies But new controversies  including a battery charge against his campaign manager for roughing up a reporter and Trumps statement this week that women who receive illegal abortions should be punished  threatened to thwart his momentumThe party also appeared to be fraying beyond repair with Trump Cruz and the third remaining presidential candidate Gov John Kasich of Ohio all backing away this week from their pledges to support the eventual GOP nomineeA Wisconsin poll released on Wednesday suggested trouble was brewing in that state for TrumpThe survey by Marquette Law School said that Cruz had surged to 40 percent support among likely voters up 21 points since February  enough to give him a 10point lead over TrumpWisconsin should be favorable terrain for Trump The state is home to a large contingent of Republican voters without college degrees a demographic that has backed himFortytwo delegates are at stake in Tuesdays primary allocated in a hybrid system based on victories in congressional districts and the statewide voteMuch of Wisconsins Republican establishment led by Gov Scott Walker a onetime presidential candidate has rallied around Cruz as the best hope of defeating TrumpIn an interview Thursday Walker pointed to the support Cruz has been receiving from the states popular conservative radio talk show hosts as a key factor in giving the Texas senator the ability to compete against TrumpWalker said Cruz is the only candidate who can clear the primary and also win the general electionArguably there are two candidates who can mathematically win the nomination he said There are two candidates who have a shot at beating Hillary Clinton Ted Cruz is the only one in both categoriesThe impact of the radio hosts came into clear view during a sweep of Trump interviews earlier this week Trump struggled in responding to avowed antiTrump radio host Charlie Sykes who has enormous influence among conservatives in the state Sykes hammered the candidate on the tone of the campaign homing in on Trumps recent feud with Cruz during which Trump ignited accusations of misogyny after he reposted an unflattering image of Cruzs wife HeidiI expect that from a 12yearold bully on the playground not somebody who wants the office held by Abraham Lincoln Sykes saidIn his appearances this week in Wisconsin Trump irritated some conservatives by seeming to mock two of the states favorite sons Walker and House Speaker Paul D Ryan His harshest comments came during an appearance in Janesville Ryans hometownTrump dismissed Walkers support for Cruz and poked fun at the governors obsession with HarleyDavidson motorcyclesThe motorcycle guys like Trump Trump said And he doesnt look like a motorcycle guy to me Im sorryWhen Trump asked attendees how they liked Ryan your new speaker the crowd responded with boos and jeersA loss in Wisconsin would not necessarily affect the outcomes of future states The next big contest is Trumps home state of New York where he is favored to win A string of primaries in East Coast states in April could pad his delegate lead The next Midwest contest in Indiana is not until May 3Still Trump made clear during his Janesville rally this week that he does not intend to loseIm not going to let anything happen in Wisconsin he said We have to win Look we have to put these politicians in their place folksDan Balz Scott Clement and Dave Weigel contributed to this report
