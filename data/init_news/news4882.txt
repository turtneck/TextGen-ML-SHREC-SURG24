Marco Rubio is in an enviable position among mainstream Republican presidential candidates after his strong finish in Iowa Yet the man is running scaredThe young Floridian is stumping through New Hampshire as if hes campaigning to win the Cautious Caucus He gives the same speech everywhere The most tightly managed candidate in the race he shuns risk and appears to live in mortal terror of mentioning the man who dominates the raceAt a town hall event here in central New Hampshire on Wednesday morning Rubio as usual didnt mention Donald Trump in his speech But the first questioner a businesswoman practically begged the candidate to trash Trump asking him to comment on Trumps very definite views of the disabled including calling people stupid and attempting to remove disabled veterans from one of his propertiesRubio demurred saying only that he had already called out Donald for his distasteful mocking of a disabled reporter at an event He then dropped the Trump talk and moved onRival Chris Christie mocked Rubio on Tuesday as the boy in the bubble managed by his handlers This criticism apparently smoked Rubio out because he took a few questions from reporters before his event in Laconia NH on Wednesday afternoonThe first questioner noted that Rubio had poked other candidates but not Mr Trump WhyDonald hasnt really outlined any position on policies Rubio reasoned So when the time comes and its appropriate well do soWhy do you deliver the same speech wherever you go the second questioner askedCause its my message he said Its the reason Im running for presidentRubios determination not to be taken off of this bland message or to engage Trump may give the impression that he is above the fray But it also can make him look weak and callowWhile other candidates particularly Jeb Bush have denounced Trumps outrages Rubio and allied groups have spent upward of 30million on ads so far  some of it targeting Bush Christie and Ted Cruz but none of it targeting Trump Rubio has mentioned Trump a couple of times on Twitter In debates he has frequently deflects questions about the mogulAfter the December debate in which Rubio declined a chance to take on Trumps proposed ban on Muslims entering the country Fox News asked Rubio why he hadnt gone after Trump Rubio said he wasnt going to spend a valuable 75 seconds on a debate stage talking about something thats never going to happenLikewise asked to comment on Trumps qualifications as a conservative Rubio said that the billionaire is running as someone whos a populist whos upset about the direction of this country as am I as are millions of AmericansOn other occasions Rubio declined to talk about Trumps mosqueclosing ideas well I think we need to target radicalism and Trumps plan for mass deportation of illegal immigrants both sides have points to make here that are validAsked back in September whether he would engage Trump Rubio replied No Im ready to talk about who I am and why Im runningIts not as if Trump returns the politeness Ann Coulter warming up a Trump crowd Tuesday night called Rubio a Cuban boy who wears high heels and has big ears Evercautious Rubio ridiculed last month for wearing booties with thick heels quickly retired the offending footwearRubios strong Iowa finish has brought new attention  and overcapacity crowds  in New Hampshire But the wouldbe supporters are greeted by a robotThe closest Rubio gets to Trump in his stump speech is observing as he did here in Bow that you have a right to be angry but anger is not a plan What exactly do you want to do Or as he put it in Laconia a few hours later Anger is not a plan Frustration is not a plan You have a right to be frustrated You have a right to be angry  But what exactly are you going to do about itVoters questions rather than spurring spontaneity inspire more caution Asked Wednesday what hed do about the millions of illegal immigrants who otherwise havent broken any law Rubio said Well figure something outThe logic behind Rubios candidacy recited in his speeches is that as he put it in Bow I give us the best chance to win and if you dont believe me ask a Democrat They do not want to run against me Or as he said in Laconia If Im our nominee we will win and the Democrats know this They do not want to run against meIf he keeps playing the boy in the bubble they may reconsiderRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
