The libertarian moment in American politicsforetold just last year in the New York Times magazineis like the horizon always retreating as we advance upon itThe political events of 2015 are a brutal reminder about how far this country is from embracing libertarianism and how alien those ideas are even to the purported shock troops of the freedom movement While libertarianisms opponents can take heart its champions are setting their cause back by pretending that all is wellThe collapse of the Rand Paul campaign speaks volumes In a 15person field Paul is the only candidate who looks even remotely libertarian social tolerance foreign policy restraint and limited government He started the campaign with decent name recognition a seat in the United States Senate lavish media attention a serious will to win and a battletested national political operation inherited from his father RonIf there were any significant support for Libertarian ideas in the GOPany at allRand Paul would be near the top of an otherwise crowded fragmented field that is fighting over every nonlibertarian voter in the partyYet hes polling at a mere 1 percent among Republican voters nationwide and has a higher unfavorability rating than anyone else in the GOP raceAccording to an August survey by the independent polling firm Eschelon Insights far and away the most popular candidate nationwide among libertarianinclined Republicans is Donald Trump the least libertarian candidate in the raceLibertarians who cant stomach Trump scattered their support without any ideological rhyme or reason 11 percent for Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush 9 percent for Ted Cruz and John Kasich 8 percent for Carly Fiorina 7 percent for PaulThe secret of Trumps appeal to Pauls base is that a large segment of the Ron Paul Revolution leavened its libertarianism with a pony keg of crazy Birthers 911 Truthers a wide assortment of conspiracy theorists many of whom believe the Federal Reserve to be a modern manifestation of the Illuminati and naked racists rivaled the number of reasonably sober libertarianish voters among the faithfulTrump won their hearts by throwing even more crazy into the mix and stirring up a white working class populism last given political life by George WallacePaul let these voters down because he was disinclined to offer the distasteful dog whistles that his father traded for extremist support much less the louder baser appeals that are Trumps stockintradeThe second voter bloc Rand Paul hoped to bring into his campTea Partiershas likewise rejected the Kentucky Republican Thats because there are few Libertarians there eitherAccording to a survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute more than half the Tea Party is made up of the religious right while only 26 percentthe smallest ideological bloc within the groupcan be loosely described as LibertarianAnd Tea Partiers have always manifested a large degree of nativist populismIt should be no surprise then that the candidates doing best with Tea Partiers are Donald Trump 37 percent support Ted Cruz 19 percent and Ben Carson 14 percent Rand Paul Two percentSure one can argue that Paul has run a subpar campaign and that a more adroit effort would have produced better resultsBut given the above it is hard to argue as some do that Paul would have done better had he run as more of a libertarianIf real libertarian votes were there for the taking someone would have come along and done the harvestingIf there was truly a 20 electoral bill lying on the sidewalk its hard to believe that none of the other 14 starving candidates would bother to pick it upYet this is precisely the narrative that the prophets of the Libertarian vote would have us believe an epic political market failureTheres good reason that political professionalsthose with the most to gain from an accurate reading of the political landscapedo not pander to the libertarian vote It doesnt existThe most thorough search for libertarian sentiment was conducted last year by the Pew Research CenterThey asked 10013 adults 23 questions about a variety of social and political issues and then used cluster analysis to sort respondents into homogeneous groups Pew found that Americans who resembled libertarians form a group that is too small to analyze no more than 5 percent of those surveyedIts true that if we avoid asking people about concrete issues and instead ask general questions we can if we squint hard enough see a great deal of latent libertarian sentiment out thereIt has been noted for instance that 59 percent of the American public is broadly speaking libertarian in that they answer yes to the question Would you define yourself as fiscally conservative and socially liberalPolitical scientists and campaign strategists however almost universally dismiss selfidentification and general sentiment surveys as functionally meaningless Both academic investigation and hardearned political experience tell us that attitudes about specific governmental programs are far more telling than asking people what labels or characterizations describe them bestLibertarians however can take heart from the fact that political sentiment is moving their way in some areas Gay rights drug decriminalization increasing outrage over heavyhanded police tactics growing concern over an unjust legal system disgust over crony capitalism and opposition to military deployments abroad all suggest that libertarian arguments can have political force But just because people buy libertarian arguments when it comes to civil liberties or foreign policy does not mean they are more likely to buy them on taxes spending or regulation If they were then Bernie Sanders Democrats would be Rand Paul RepublicansLibertarians love to preach the virtues of markets Yet in the marketplace of ideas their bundled product has been regularly and thoroughly rejected for over a centuryUntil libertarians acknowledge that market verdict and rethink either what theyre selling how theyre selling it or both they will remain on the margins of American political life And for friends of liberty that would be a tragedyJerry Taylor is the president of the Niskanen Centera think tank in Washington DC dedicated to the advancement of liberty and pragmatic policy solutions
