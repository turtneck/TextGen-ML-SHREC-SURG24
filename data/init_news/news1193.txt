Gay and lesbian couples could face legal chaos if the Supreme Court rules against samesex marriage in the next few weeksSamesex weddings could come to a halt in many states depending on a confusing mix of lowercourt decisions and the sometimescontradictory views of state and local officialsAmong the 36 states in which samesex couples can now marry are 20 in which federal judges invoked the Constitution to strike down marriage bansThose rulings would be in conflict with the nations highest court if the justices uphold the power of states to limit marriage to heterosexual couples A decision is expected by late June in cases from Kentucky Michigan Ohio and TennesseeTop officials in some states including California seem determined to allow gay and lesbian couples to continue to marry no matter how the court decision comes out But some county clerks who actually issue marriage licenses might not go along experts saidIn other states a high court ruling in favor of state bans would serve to prohibit any more such unions but also could give rise to new efforts to repeal marriage bans through the legislature or the ballotThe scenario may be unlikely given the Supreme Courts role in allowing those lower court rulings to take effect before the justices themselves decided the issue But if the court doesnt endorse samesex marriage nationwide it would be chaos said Howard Wasserman a Florida International University law professorMarriages already on the books probably are safe said several scholars and civil liberties lawyers Theres a very strong likelihood these marriages would have to be respected no matter what said Christopher Stoll senior staff attorney with the National Center for Lesbian RightsGay and lesbian couples could continue to marry in the 16 states that have samesex marriage because of state court rulings acts of the legislature or statewide votesSimilarly the 14 states that prohibit samesex couples from marrying including the four directly involved in the Supreme Court cases could continue enforcing their state marriage laws That would include Alabama where a federal judge has struck down the states constitutional ban on samesex marriage but put her ruling on hold pending the high courts decisionOf the remaining 20 states any that fought unsuccessfully to preserve marriage bans would not have much trouble resuming enforcement That state can immediately start saying were going to deny marriage licenses to samesex couples going forward said Cornell University law professor Michael DorfThat list might include Alaska Arizona Florida Idaho Indiana Kansas Montana Nevada North Carolina Oklahoma South Carolina Utah West Virginia Wisconsin and WyomingOfficials in some of those states refused to comment on how they would respond citing the ongoing Supreme Court case Im just not going to speculate on what the court may or may not do said Kansas Gov Sam BrownbackThings might be different in California Colorado Oregon Pennsylvania and Virginia because top elected officials did not contest lowercourt rulings in favor of samesex marriage Courts in those states issued orders or injunctions that forbid the state from enforcing the constitutional amendments or state laws that limit marriage to a man and a womanTypically a participant in the lawsuit that led to the injunction has to ask the judge to undo it But if the governor and attorney general are samesex marriage supporters they may have little incentive to go back into court In California for instance Gov Jerry Brown and Attorney General Kamala Harris both opposed Proposition 8 the state constitutional amendment that prohibited samesex marriage I think its very unlikely that anyone would try to turn back the clock in California Stoll saidBut Gene Schaerr a Washingtonbased lawyer who has defended samesex marriage bans said he thinks even in states where the political leadership favors gay and lesbian unions county clerks who actually issue marriage licenses would be on safe ground if they were to deny licenses to samesex couplesIn Schaerrs view only the clerks in Alameda and Los Angeles counties are bound by the 2010 injunction issued by US District Judge Vaughn Walker A Supreme Court ruling rejecting a constitutional right to marry for samesex couples would free the clerks in counties other than Los Angeles and Alameda to adhere to Proposition 8 Schaerr saidColorado Attorney General Cynthia Coffman a Republican said she supports samesex marriage but believes voters need to remove the marriage ban from the state constitution  and would replace it with legal protection for samesex marriage if given the chance Coffman said she would gladly defend such an outcomeIf samesex marriages cease in Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring would try to get the state General Assembly to repeal the states statutory and constitutional bans Herring spokesman Michael Kelly saidSome gay rights groups and state officials said the chance the court would not come out in favor of samesex marriage is remoteRecent history of the past eight months plus all the rulings of the past 20 years dont indicate that to us this is going to go against us said Tom Witt executive director of gay rights organization Equality Kansas It could but a giant meteor could fall on my head in the next five seconds
