It was on a hot July day in 2013 six months after he joined the Senate that Ted Cruz began what would become his winning campaign in IowaAt a faith gathering at the Des Moines Marriott the Texan bowed his head as pastors laid their hands on his shoulders to pray Meanwhile the senators aides collected their names and email addresses starting a database of evangelical leaders that would swell over the following months and years Cruzs father Rafael himself a preacher looked on beamingDonald Trump began his Iowa campaign with a business trip He landed here in January 2015 to address a land investment expo but unbeknownst to the political world he also started to build his campaignIowa was a foreign place to the Manhattan mogul and Trump knew he needed two things credibility and a fast tutorial He sought to gain both through Chuck Laudner a veteran Iowa operativeTrump invited Laudner and his wife Stephanie into his SUV He poured on the charm He leaned in to listen as Laudner explained Iowas political topography  the 99 counties the caucus math the glut of disengaged Iowans who might be persuaded to come out for the right candidateTrump later brought the couple aboard his Boeing 757 where they sat in plush leather chairs with goldplated seatbelt buckles and sipped soft drinks Trump tried to make a deal  and Laudner was sold The Trump candidacy would soon be born and the businessman would try to win over Iowa just as he had won over Laudner by the power of his own seductionThere was yet a third playbook that of Marco Rubio The senator from Florida banked on rising late His supporters grumbled that he showed disdain for the campaign grind during a fiveday Iowa swing in November he took the third day off to watch footballBut Rubio believed that Iowa could be won with an air war and a late burst of activity In the final three weeks his ads were ubiquitous on televisions here As he crossed the state last weekend sounding an optimistic call for Republican unity his campaign paid to beam a 30minute video of him on the stump into homes in each of Iowas media marketsRubios strategy proved highly effective as he surged to a surprisingly strong third place just one percentage point behind TrumpBut in a state that has long rewarded conservatives who put religion at the fore and in a political era dictated by data analytics Cruz won on the strength of both His message was perfectly tuned to Iowa conservatives he used his web of relationships to try to unite evangelical leaders and he invested deeply in data and turnout organization By caucus day Cruz had 11986 volunteers in Iowa and trained captains at nearly all of the 1681 precinctsWe formed the philosophy that our campaign would be waged by neighbors telling their neighbors who to vote for and we needed to set up every piece and shred of data to allow that to happen said Jeff Roe Cruzs campaign managerThat approach was paying off by the beginning of the year Cruz had a clear lead in the polls His list of endorsements was growing by the day Crowds were swelling even when he stopped by gas stations near midnightOn a sixday 28stop bus tour in early January through farflung pockets of Iowa Cruz sounded triumphant Father God please keep this awakening going he said in Mason CityStill two threats started to emergeRubios peak late strategy was ramping up and he started to directly engage Cruz with a new fervor He also began talking about his faith everywhere he wentRubio had a model in Sen Joni Ernst RIowa who has found support from both the right and the center of Iowas GOP going back to 2014 when she navigated a crowded primary in spite of her ties to the party establishment Rubio was guided by Ernsts strategist Todd Harris who recognized that suburban Republicans could compete with the states conservative wingWe went fishing where the fishes are Harris said We knew exactly who the voters we wanted to talk to were A lot of them were suburban Its no surprise Rubio was dubbed the mayor of Ankeny People made a lot of fun at that but we knew what we were doingThen there was Trump Around the beginning of the year his gut was telling him he could be the winner He started to attack hard hitting Cruz on his Canadian birth on previously undisclosed loans on his nasty reputation in WashingtonI am putting myself a little bit out there Trump said in an interview in the boys locker room at Muscatine High School where he held a rally late last month If I come in second I come in second I think were going to come in first frankly I could say Oh well I just want to do wellTrump rolled his eyes I want to win he said I want to winHours after Trumps June 16 announcement that he was running he flew to Des Moines for his first rally Attendees at the Hoyt Sherman auditorium were revved up The reigning Miss Iowa was there Cub Scouts recited the Pledge of Allegiance With Neil Youngs Keep On Rocking in the Free World blaring Trump was surrounded as he slowly made his way down the aisleAs he left the rally Trump asked campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Why arent we going to win this stateTrumps onagain offagain romance with Iowa had begun He would spar with the states biggest newspaper the Des Moines Register and bar its reporters from his events When Ben Carson briefly surpassed him in the polls in the fall he took to the stage in Fort Dodge and wondered resentfully How stupid are the people of IowaBut Trump always believed he could will himself to victory here Early on Laudner director of Trumps Iowa campaign described the strategy in the state as a parallel campaign Rather than focusing on the roughly 120000 Republicans who regularly caucus he targeted nontraditional voters  people who wouldnt be caught dead at a Republican eventThat included Trumps lieutenants Tana Goertz a political neophyte best known for being a runnerup on Trumps NBC show The Apprentice was tapped as Iowa cochair She used her own celebrity as a former spokeswoman for the Bedazzler a rhinestonesetting machine popular with homecrafts enthusiasts to draw in volunteersOne brisk night last week Goertz was at Trumps Iowa headquarters carrying a carton of beads and shiny plastic gems as she headed out to a call center She rewarded the most dedicated volunteers by Bedazzling their Make America Great Again Tshirts and hatsGoertz also recorded a cheery YouTube video with instructions on how to caucus It was viewed more than 200000 timesDuring the summer as Trump whipped up throngs of fans from Alabama to Arizona aides drove a hulking royalblue bus around Iowa wowing locals and signing up potential supportersBy late August Trump had surged to the lead for the first time in the Registers Iowa pollBut he had difficulty sustaining his momentum Enthusiasm for Carson was growing Trumps flippant comment at an August gathering of evangelicals that he occasionally had a little cracker when he attended church and rarely if ever asked God for forgiveness sowed doubts about his characterHis operation now had a dozen staffers in Iowa but his organizing was shrouded in mystery Republican operatives became dubious and saw little evidence of a Trump ground gameWhile other campaigns happily showcased packed phone banks and detailed complex data applications Trumps did neither After years of being a favorite source of quotations for Iowa reporters Laudner went in his words radio silentFrom his first trip to Iowa three summers ago Cruz was plotting his path to the caucusesCruzs father Rafael journeyed to every corner of the state again and again huddling with pastors and preaching in churches He told the story of his emigration from Cuba and testified to Teds character conviction and conservatismTo run his Iowa campaign Cruz interviewed several seasoned consultants but settled on a former Baptist pastor named Bryan English who had deep ties to the evangelical networks led by Rep Steve King and Bob Vander Plaats head of the conservative group the Family Leader English was an unusual hire but the move underscored Cruzs strategyDo you set up your operation with a bunch of khakislacks blueblazer clowns Roe Cruzs campaign manager asked Or do you set it up with an activistBack at national headquarters in Houston Roe and his team invested several million dollars in a data analytics operation There were about 175000 Republicans in Iowa who had participated in a presidential caucus and Cruzs statisticians and behavioral psychologists set out to learn everything they could about themThe campaign conducted psychological targeting of likely caucusgoers building its own version of a MyersBriggs personality test to categorize Republicans so it could send them personally tailored phone calls mail and other messagesSitting in his office last week with warstrategy tomes by Sun Tzu and Carl von Clausewitz stacked on his desk English looked out at the bustling phone bank which on this afternoon included Rafael CruzIf anybody goes to caucus and says I havent seen Ted Cruz I want it to be their fault not ours English saidFor the first six months of the campaign he was the lone Cruz staffer in Iowa and he worked out of the basement of his home By August though there was a headquarters in Urbandale then more staffers The team grew to 20 and Cruz rented out a dormitory building in Des Moines  Camp Cruz  to house volunteers from Texas and other places who came in the final month to help canvassCruz peeled supporters from former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee who together won the past two caucuses with heavy support from evangelicals and homeschool parents Cruz also targeted the libertarian followers of former congressman Ron Paul whose son Sen Rand Paul RKy was proving to be less popular than his father in his presidential bidBy January the Cruz campaign had so much information about Iowa Republicans that it believed it could pinpoint exactly which ones were certain to caucus for Cruz which were undecided and which were leaning toward competitorsTen days before the caucuses the internal data based on a turnout of 150000 people which would set a new record showed that 19186 were certain to be with Cruz About 1400 had supported him at one point but had turned to another candidate they got personal phone calls from Ted his wife Heidi or Rafael Cruz in a push to win them backOnly 15626 people were certain to caucus for Trump according to the figures The Cruz campaign believed it was winningThe decision facing Trump was straightforward shower attention on Iowa in the final days only to risk a humbling defeat or turn to New Hampshire and South Carolina the next two states to vote where he enjoyed substantial leadsThe real estate magnate chose to roll the dice propelled in part by his irritation at watching television pundits say that Cruz was likely to winSo Trump reminded Iowans again and again about Cruzs opposition to federal renewablefuel standards an issue critical to the states powerful ethanol industry In that Trump had an ally in Gov Terry Branstad R who broke his neutrality to call for Cruzs defeatTrump also raised questions about Cruzs Canadian birth first in an interview with The Washington Post and then at almost every rally and on TV The issue dogged Cruz A man dressed in a Royal Canadian Mounted Police uniform trailed him and a super PAC supporting Rubio ran an ad depicting Cruzs face inside Canadas iconic maple leaf Huckabees super PAC aired a provocative ad suggesting that Cruz was a millionaire that brags about his faith but does not titheThere were signs that the right was not united behind Cruz Former vicepresidential nominee Sarah Palin a tea party and evangelical heroine endorsed Trump at a splashy rally in AmesThe nightly surveys conducted by the Cruz campaign showed that Palin was a boon for Trump  67 percent of Iowa Republicans had heard of her endorsement and of them 19 percent were more likely to support Trump Only 13 percent were less likely toA few days later Trump won the backing of Jerry Falwell Jr son of the late televangelist and president of Liberty University The two men campaigned together across Iowa the weekend before the caucusesRubio also was making an overt play for evangelical support airing ads about his faith and opposition to abortion and talking on the stump about God as if he were a Sunday school teacherNot everyone was sure that Rubios embrace of the religious right would work some thought he was going too far in his attempt to win Iowa Rubios mistake is that hes moved too far toward the Christian right when he should be focused on the mainstream Doug Gross an unaffiliated Iowa Republican power broker said in DecemberAttendees at Rubios events often would say that they were drawn to him not out of passion but out of a desire to back someone more moderate who had a chance to win in the general electionAt a Rubio stop in the late fall in West Des Moines Carol and Pete Click said they drove through an icy mush and argued politely along the way about the senator from Florida Pete 65 a retired business owner said he wasnt enthusiastic but Carol urged her husband to give Rubio a second lookAll right Im open to it Pete told his wife Im tired of the establishment but Trump is a problem and maybe he needs to be stopped hereCarol replied with a chuckle Weve never caucused for someone with a chance of winning the general election Its about timeIn the past two weeks Rubio shifted as he saw an opening with Cruz and Trump bloodying each other He kept up his citation of Bible passages and channeled voter anger but began to speak more of his ability to bring the party together as others clashed He was a bridgebuilder with conservative credentialsIt worked Entrance polls of caucusgoers showed that he won over voters in Iowa who waited until the final week to choose a candidateOn the eve of the caucuses Cruz returned to Des Moines for a Sunday evening rally at the state fairgroundsThe crowd was deeply religious with children wearing church youthgroup Tshirts and two elderly couples up front holding hands in prayer The videos that played on oversize screens before Cruz went on featured soaring guitar chords mixed with testimonials from conservative leaders Rep Steve King rallied the crowd with an introduction that assured people Cruz was spoonfed the Constitution and the Bible as a childCruz cast himself as the one true conservative in the race Stand with us Caucus for us If we stand together we will winThe crowd roared A day later they stood with him
