Zeid Raad Al Hussein has really hit the nail on the head here Not only has he correctly pointed out that Trump Nigel Farage Marine LePen Geert Wilders and the rest of the farright leaders employ the tactics of fear and bigotry but he also correctly identifies their agenda as being the promotion of hatred with the eventual result that colossal violence will ensueHowever he does not go far enough in exposing these scumbags most likely because he knows he would be placing himself in the crosshairs of the Zionists who stand behind these puppetsWhat went unsaid is that all of these people are stooges for the Zionists and Israel they are tasked with creating horrible divisions in our societies turning white against brown and black Christian against Muslim indigenous against migrantThis is the Zionist agenda to weaken and enslave via the strategy of divide and conquer as laid out in the Protocols of Zion They want to destroy our nations by promoting interracial hatred and violence they want to see the nation states of the west burn down in a wave of racially motivated violence that is why Trump spouts such hateful and disgusting rhetoric against Mexicans blacks and Muslims it is to
