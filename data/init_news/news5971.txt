Russias countersanctions for Syria will hit the West below the belt 08112016 Print version Font Size The West and Russia are entering the third year of the war of sanctions  Washington threatens to impose new sanctions against Russia this time for Syria Russia will take painful measures in response Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said PravdaRu offers the list of counter sanctions that we made up on the basis of experts opinions 1 Russias first answer would be the abolition of neoliberal economic policies and transition to a new economic development strategy  This will block channels of Western influence on our country and thus become the most asymmetric but a tough answer to Western sanctions said Ruslan Dzarasov Doctor of Economics head of the department of political economy at the Russian Economic University named after PlekhanovThe expert noted that we continue to adhere to the export growth model taking capital to the West and forming the budget on the basis of financial interests of capital rather than domestic consumers Russia the expert said should introduce a combination of state planning and market sector similar to what the USSR was doing during the 1920s The state should ensure the financial transparency of corporations expand the rights of trade unions and workers strengthen social control over big business show influence on the formation prices in economy to eliminate price disparity in favor of the mining export sector to the detriment of the manufacturing industry Ruslan Dzarasov told PravdaRu2 Russia could refuse from saving its reserves in US dollars  Russia does not take the first place in terms of dollar savings in the world but it could still cause a serious blow on the Western financial system Valentin Katasonov Doctor of Economics Professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Finance the head of Russian Economic Society named after SF Sharapov told PravdaRuA lot of Russias liabilities in national gold and currency reserves are nominated in US dollars Should they are put on the market the US dollar will suffer greatly  leading expert at the Union of Oil and Gas Industrialists Rustam Tankan said Noteworthy some privately run Russian companies already abandon the US dollar in their activities Megafon one of Russias three leading cellular providers converted about 40 percent of dollar deposits in euros and Hong Kong dollars The company transferred the funds to accounts in major Chinese banks Norilsk Nickel took similar measures The Hong Kong dollar is a Chinese foreign clone of the dollar and the USA is unable to impose any sanctions on this currency  Russia has started abandoning from the US dollar as a reserve currency by opening the Raw Materials Exchange of St Petersburg where Russian energy carriers are traded in rubles 3 Russia could freeze assets of US investors in the Russian economy  Foreign citizens are the ultimate beneficiaries of our shadow holdings There are tricky financial mechanisms in the timber industry for instance Igor Gerasimov member of the Committee for Business Security at the Chamber of Commerce security expert told PravdaRu The shadow mechanism works as follows A woodworking company does most of the work while most of the profit goes to a general contractor The latter pays the company a relative price for production plus a minimum profit Most of the profit goes to specific individuals to accounts of foreign companies Therefore Russia could adopt laws about the nationalization of natural resources and cityforming enterprises said Igor Gerasimov4 The State Duma of the Russian Federation has already discussed a draft law to relieve staterun and privatelyowned Russian companies from debts totaling 700 billion  These debts are held by Western banks of the countries that threatened to impose sanctions against Russia5 Sanctions in the field of high technology will be no less sensitive Russian titanium will cease to arrive at European companies and this will certainly be a very significant act of pressure on our partners Alexei Mukhin general director of the Center for Political Information told PravdaRu Boeing and United Technologies as well as Europes Airbus Group purchase most of their titanium from Avisma a Russian company which happens to be the worlds largest titanium producer  Yet it goes about only 30 percent of needs The USA remains entirely dependent on Russia in the field of rocket engines  RD180 is a sixton liquid rocket engine with a thrust of more than 400 tons The USA has been using Russian rocket engines since 2000 US Congress passed the budget which provided for the allocation of hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase an unlimited number of RD180 rocket engines 6 Russias sanctions against Western airlines would lead to their elimination  A great deal of airlines fly across the territory of Russia and save a lot of money on this chairman of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Andrei Klimov told PravdaRuIf all of a sudden the Russian authorities try to do something in this field it will generate huge profits to companies from such countries as the United Arab Emirates but at the same time it will cause serious financial damage to German French and other air carriers  said the expert7 Many large companies in the West have a strong lobby in legislative authorities Therefore the input of targeted sanctions under the pretext of violation of rules and regulations would be a very strong response  Starting from 1 November 2016 Russia banned imports of salt from the EU the US Canada Australia Iceland Liechtenstein Montenegro Albania and Ukraine On February 15 2016 Russia banned imports of soybeans and corn from the United States including through third countries Russia still imports various food products from the United States spending millions of dollars a year PepsiCo Starbucks Cargill McDonalds pharmaceuticals Pfizer cosmetic products Procter  Gamble Johnson  Johnson plastics machinery textiles footwear automobiles Ford General Motors as well as products under the secret code worth 554 million in the first half of 2016
