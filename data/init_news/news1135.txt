Jebs tried to be what the voters want him to be but it hasnt been enough and on Friday it all seemed to be drawing to a closeBush is polling on average at 103 percent in the state behind Donald Trump Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio On Friday the biggest story about his campaign was one that declared it was running on fumes hemorrhaging confidence from his supporters and donors just when he needs it most As a last resort 24 hours before the Republican primary he dragged his 90 year old mother Barbara out on the campaign trail with him for three separate town hall eventsHe stood at the center of the stage no lectern and awkwardly dangled his stiff arms at his sides as he spoke Thanks to his Paleo diet he is a shell of his former self sleek and modern in a slimcut blazer and pants On this particular day he wore no glassesMuch has been said about Bushs demeanor throughout this campaign He seems to vacillate between detachment and frustration with the process At times he just seems sad giving the sort of contemplative spaced out looks that make for the perfect absurdist Vines Its not the kind of viral content a campaign hopes for exactly but then this is not the sort of campaign that the candidate had hoped for eitherIn Bushs mind the media has dictated the supposedly Democratic process in 2016 and treated it like a tabloid story feeding the American publics appetite for more drama read Trump Too wonky and polite to serve as a lead Bush has become a bit character in this season of America and frankly this is not the sort of arc he was promised at the initial castingWere all part of a narrative he said mockingly borrowing the language of TV political pundits I always thought narratives were part of a play you know where you just kind of play out your part The narrative is that theres an establishment lane and then theres the outsider lane and Im in the establishment lane because I am the son of George HW Bush and the brother of George W Bush I got that Im proud of it It doesnt bother me a bitLater as he posed for a photo he complained to a supporter about how hard it is to break through because of the media The media as it was stood huddled around him within earshot He made awkward eye contact and swiftly told the supporter that the medias job of vetting presidential candidates is actually important work and personally he welcomes the scrutinyA man jostled to get his baby girls photo taken with the next president of the United States getting into an argument with a photographer who stood in his way in the process It was jarring to hear someone describe Bush that way as the next president because unlike other candidates he doesnt even pretend like he thinks itll happenDuring a speech in January Cruz said When Heidis first lady french fries are coming back to the cafeteria It was a joke ostensibly but you get the feeling sometimes that before theyve even won a considerable number of delegates candidates are making plans to redo the molding and install a hot tub in the Oval OfficeIn contrast during his speech on Friday Bush said at one point I think the first thing that our president should do Not the first thing that I will do as president but the first thing that our president should doAnd maybe thats why he hasnt gained momentum to borrow another phrase from the pundits Bush a genteel WASP spent a great deal of time on Friday condemning what he perceives to be Trumps rudeness but what Trumps supporters believe is his matteroffactness Donald Trump man insulting women Hispanics the disabled POWs like John McCain he said Donald Trump has never showed any interest in anybody else other than himself
