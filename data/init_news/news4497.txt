Fact Check Was Planned Parenthood Started To Control The Black PopulationBen Carson alleged in an interview with Fox News Wednesday that Planned Parenthood puts most of its clinics in black neighborhoods to control the population and that its founder Margaret Sanger was not particularly enamored with black peoplePlanned Parenthood has been a target on the campaign trail after a series of sting videos was released alleging the organization illegally profits from selling aborted fetal tissue Carson a famed neurosurgeon turned Republican presidential candidate has been a vocal opponent of the group He was also in the news this week after reports surfaced that he once used aborted fetal tissue for researchOn Fox News Wednesday Carson was asked about Democrats criticism that Republicans who want to defund Planned Parenthood are waging a war on women He respondedIts not the first time Planned Parenthood has faced criticism about its founder and the placement of its clinics  former presidential candidate Herman Cain made a similar statement in 2011In response Planned Parenthood said Carson was not only wrong on the facts hes flatout insulting Alencia Johnson assistant director of constituency communications told NPRDid Margaret Sanger believe in eugenicsYes but not in the way Carson impliedEugenics was a discipline championed by prominent scientists but now widely debunked that promoted good breeding and aimed to prevent poor breeding The idea was that the human race could be bettered through encouraging people with traits like intelligence hard work cleanliness thought to be genetic to reproduce Eugenics was taken to its horrifying extreme during the Holocaust through forced sterilizations and breeding experimentsIn the United States eugenics intersected with the birth control movement in the 1920s and Sanger reportedly spoke at eugenics conferences She also talked about birth control being used to facilitate the process of weeding out the unfit and of preventing the birth of defectivesHistorians seem to disagree on just how involved in the eugenics movement she was Some contend her involvement was for political reasons  to win support for birth controlIn reading her papers it is clear Sanger had bought into the movement She once wrote that consequences of breeding from stock lacking human vitality always will give us social problems and perpetuate institutions of charity and crimeThat Sanger was enamored and supported some eugenicists ideas is certainly true said Susan Reverby a health care historian and professor at Wellesley College But Reverby added Sangers main argument was not eugenics  it was that Sanger thought people should have the children they wantedIt was a radical idea for the timeSanger wrote about this mission herself in 1921 The almost universal demand for practical education in Birth Control is one of the most hopeful signs that the masses themselves today possess the divine spark of regenerationWas Sanger not particularly enamored with black peopleSangers birth control movement did have support in black neighborhoods beginning in the 20s when there were leagues in Harlem started by AfricanAmericans Sanger also worked closely with NAACP founder WEB DuBois on a Negro Project which she viewed as a way to get safe contraception to AfricanAmericansIn 1946 Sanger wrote about the importance of giving Negro parents a choice in how many children they would haveThe Negro race has reached a place in its history when every possible effort should be made to have every Negro child count as a valuable contribution to the future of America she wrote Negro parents like all parents must create the next generation from strength not from weakness from health not from despairHer attitude toward AfricanAmericans can certainly be viewed as paternalistic but there is no evidence she subscribed to the more racist ideas of the time or that she coerced black women into using birth control In fact for her time as the Washington Post noted she would likely be considered to have advanced views on race relationsAre most of Planned Parenthoods clinics in black neighborhoodsIn 2014 the Guttmacher Institute a reproductive health research center surveyed all known abortion providers including Planned Parenthood clinics in the US nearly 2000 and found that 60 percent are in majoritywhite neighborhoodsPlanned Parenthood has not released numbers on the neighborhoods of its specific clinics but responding to a request for demographic information the organization said that in 2013 14 percent of its patients nationwide were black Thats nearly equal to the proportion of the AfricanAmerican population in the USHowever Carson is tapping into a more subtle sentiment  the targeting of AfricanAmericans in health care systems There have been documented cases of that happening including the nowinfamous Tuskegee study Starting in the 1930s the Tuskegee Institute enrolled black sharecroppers in experiments and allowed them to suffer from syphilis untreated though they were told they were getting treatmentAnd Wellesleys Reverby said that was sometimes the case for birth control clinics historically too They may have been available in communities where more general health care was not raising some ethical questionsOne of the issues is  what happens when you can find birth control clinics but you cant find primary care Its just a question of what the states willing to provide for Reverby said Was there overuse of birth control and sterilization in poor communities in some states Absolutely Its a complicated storyDid Sanger have a connection to Nazi GermanyNot that NPR found Sanger herself wrote in 1939 that she had joined the AntiNazi Committee and gave money my name and any influence I had with writers and others to combat Hitlers rise to power in GermanyShe also said books of hers had been destroyed and that she had intellectual friends who were sent to concentration camps or put to death Sanger did not have a connection to the Nazis but a loose association comes through her involvement in the eugenics movementAmerican and German eugenicists closely collaborated and the Nazis reportedly borrowed much of their 1933 socalled sterilization law from American models That law allowed the government to forcibly sterilize people with alleged genetic disorders
