CNN Several bombers are dead At least one alleged attacker is still on the looseAnd a key question looms as investigators race to piece together details about the attackers behind Tuesdays deadly bombings in Belgiums capital Were these men acting alone or were other members of a terror cell supporting themRaids arrests and forensic analysis are some of the tools investigators are using to get to the bottom of who was behind the attacks in Brussels which killed 31 people and wounded 270 othersTwo of the bombers were brothers And one of the bombers at the airport appears to be a man authorities named as a suspect in the Paris terror attacksBut the investigation is far from finished With at least one suspect on the run the stakes are high Belgian counterterrorism official Paul Van Tigchelt said WednesdayThere are still a number of people possibly involved in the attacks still in our country  who still pose a threat he saidHeres a look at the latest developments in the investigation and the questions they raiseBelgian federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw identified Ibrahim El Bakraoui as one of two suicide bombers at the Brussels airport and his brother Khalid El Bakraoui as the man behind a deadly suicide blast about an hour later on a train near the Maelbeek metro stationThis isnt the first time theyve come across authorities radarIbrahim El Bakraoui was deported by Turkey to the Netherlands last year a senior Turkish official told CNN The Turkish presidencys office said authorities there captured him in July 2015 and flagged him to Belgian authoritiesBelgian authorities the Turkish official said responded soon after saying he had a criminal record but no known ties to terrorismThese two deceased suicide bombers had lengthy criminal records he said but were not linked to terrorismIbrahim El Bakraoui had been sentenced in October 2010 by a Brussels criminal court to nine years behind bars for opening fire on police officers with a Kalashnikov during a robbery according to Belgian public broadcaster RTBF and CNN affiliate RTLInterpol had issued a red notice for Khalid El Bakraoui the subway bomber that noted Belgian authorities wanted him in connection with terrorism But it wasnt clear when that notice was issued or why Belgian authorities now say he had no ties to terrorismQuestion to consider If they were already on authorities radar how did the brothers manage to slip through the cracks and carry out the deadly attacksSurveillance images showing three men pushing luggage carts through the airport have played an important role as authorities work to pinpoint the suspectsAuthorities say bomber Ibrahim El Bakraoui is the man in the middle Najim Laachraoui an ISIS bombmaker is the man on the left in the picture a Belgian counterterrorism official told CNNs Paul CruickshankInvestigators believe both were killed in the airport blast But authorities are looking for the third man in the photo walking on the right and wearing lightcolored clothing and a hatBelgiums interior minister said that man placed a bomb at the airport and leftWhile two explosives went off within 37 seconds of each other shortly before 8 am this third bomb  described as the heaviest by Van Leeuw  did not instead being detonated by authorities later in a controlled explosionQuestions to consider Where did the man in lightcolored clothing go Is anyone helping him hide out from authorities and could he be plotting another attackTwo people were arrested in Brussels in connection with the attacks  one in Schaerbeek and the other in Haren Van Leeuw saidOne was released later that day according to the prosecutorAnother person was detained Wednesday according to Belgian public broadcaster RTBFOne raid officials said came after a tip from a taxi driver led them to the northeast Brussels area of SchaerbeekThe driver recognized the men shown in surveillance footage and told authorities hed driven the men to the airport before the attacks Police raided the area where the driver told them hed picked up the menOn Wednesday they made another significant find Ibrahim El Bakraouis willPolice found the airport bombers will on a computer in a trash can in Schaerbeek Van Leeuw saidThe will indicated Bakraoui needs to rush and no longer feels safeQuestions to consider Who are the people who were arrested and what was their alleged role in the attacksThe latest connection Laachraoui a suspect in the Paris attacks who authorities now say they believe was one of the Brussels airport bombersInvestigators believe Abdeslam likely planned to be part of an attack orchestrated by the same ISIS cell that carried out Tuesdays attacks a senior Belgian counterterrorism official told CruickshankThe Brussels attackers likely accelerated their plans when police discovered Abdeslams hideout investigators believeAnd one of the apartments where he hid before his capture located in the southern Brussels district of Forest allegedly has ties to one of the Bakraoui brothersQuestions to consider What role if any did Abeslams arrest play in the Brussels attacks Are there other links between the Paris and Brussels attacksAnother piece of evidence authorities found during the Brussels raids could help in their investigation unused explosivesIn the Schaerbeek residence authorities found 15 kilograms of the explosive TATP and screws among the bombmaking materials there Van Leeuw saidSuch bombs have been a signature of jihadist terrorists in the West for more than a decade because the materials are so easy to acquire unlike militarygrade explosives which are tightly controlled in much of the West CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen saidTATPbased bombs require technical knowhow and bulk purchases of hydrogen peroxide or hair bleach That helps authorities narrow down potential bombmaking suspects because making the explosives can sometimes bleach hair So authorities can identify bombmakers in part by recognizing unusually bleached hair or asking sellers to report any suspiciously large purchases of hydrogen peroxideQuestions to consider Will the bombmaking materials lead investigators to any new suspects or help them dismantle a terror cell
