The United States comes up constantly when you talk to Russians about their countrys place in the world But the conversations tend to go a lot differently than many Americans might expectIn the US the common view is that Russians feel aggrieved by the loss of the Soviet Union and all the respect that came with being a global superpower Russias acts of aggression in Europe in this telling are all about challenging the Americanled order as a way to prove Russias might and importance This aggression is wildly popular among Russians many Americans believe because it makes them feel patriotic and powerful to bully the West and particularly the US which they blame for Russias problemsRussia took off its ideological blinders in 1991 but America still seems to have them onThere is certainly truth to this but its just a piece of the truth Rather when you speak to influential people across institutions and the political spectrum in Russia as Amanda Taub and I did during a recent reporting trip there the story you hear over and over is one of Russias fundamental weakness And you hear a preoccupation with the United States that goes far beyond what even many Americans who are famously narcissistic about our country would expectIn this telling Moscow capitulated at the end of the Cold War and even tried to make itself a friend to the far more powerful United States But an irrationally aggressive America has instead sought repeatedly to weaken control or even destroy Russia Their country in this view is insecure against an overwhelmingly powerful West Its actions that we see as aggressive are actually defensive And Moscow is kept safe only by careful vigilance and by the nuclear arsenal that you hear Russians cite over and overThis is the version of history you hear in Russia from detached foreign policy pragmatists from proPutin ideologues and antiPutin ideologues even from members of the proWestern political opposition who support what they believe be to a Western agenda of weakening RussiaTheres a quote that speaks perfectly to this Russian worldview  and how Americans misunderstand it  in the most recent issue of Russia in Global Affairs a Russian foreign policy journal that is widely considered to reflect the views of Russias foreign policy establishment The quote is from a QA with Vladimir Lukin a prominent Russian diplomat and liberal politician who previously served as ambassador to the USInterviewer In his 1994 book Diplomacy Henry Kissinger writes that integrating Russia into the international system is a key task for the United States But as he was saying this the Americans were actually pushing Moscow away with their policy Why Vladimir Lukin It is in the genes America has a simple ideology  that there is only one truth in the world that truth is held by God and God created the United States to be an embodiment of that truth So the Americans strive to bring this truth to the rest of the world and to make it happy Only after that will everything be well This ideology has a strong influence on their policy A wise traditionalist and a geopolitical expert Kissinger had good reason to call such politicians Trotskyites for advocating a world revolution albeit in their own way but always in the front and in shining armor This is a tempting ideology and has been professed by different countries at different times not only the United StatesLukin is hardly seen as an antiAmerican hardliner in Russia  rather hes considered to be an objective expert on the United States and a highly professional diplomat He is a founding member of the liberal opposition party Yabloko That he would get the United States so obviously wrong  what Americans would call defending democracy and human rights he sees as a far more radical and explicitly religious agenda of advocating a world revolution  is troubling But his view is a common one and that tells you a great dealThe interviewers response is similarly telling So Russia took off its ideological blinders in 1991 but America still seems to have them on The Soviet Union is gone but the policy against it is notThis narrative of an inherently aggressive America is one we heard over and over in Moscow not just from people who support Russian President Vladimir Putin and his aggressive antiAmerican policies but even from those who oppose them In this view American politics and policies are bent on and in many ways driven by a hatred of Russia and desire to destroy or at least control it Russia has had no choice but to meet American aggression with defensive actions such as putting nuclearcapable missiles in Europe or arming eastern Ukrainian militias at threat of genocidal extermination by Americanbacked fascists if only to deter the US from further actions that could lead to allout warIts not hard to poke holes in this Russian worldview As Stephen Sestanovich a longtime senior State Department official who helped engineer the Clinton administrations Russia policies wrote in a recent article for the American Interesteven the pragmatic Russian case for annexing Crimea in March 2014 makes little strategic senseYet this was the worldview we heard even from professionals and politicians in Russia who oppose antiWestern policies One foreign policy expert who wished for rapprochement with the West sighed to us that it would be impossible because Hillary Clinton whom he said was widely viewed as irrationally antiRussian would soon take office At another meeting a political opposition leader remarked offhand that he hoped the US would be successful in its efforts to engineer regime change in MoscowAs Sestanovich writes in his essay The idea that the United States aims at a color revolution in Moscow is the single most frequently repeated theme of official Russian rhetoric This is more than paranoia or government propaganda it is the accepted worldview that Russia is under constant threat from a hostile and irrational United StatesLukin at another point in his QA lamented that the US had rejected Moscows gestures at cooperation in the 1990s and instead sought to surround Russia with a hostile NATO alliance thus forcing Russia into a defensive crouch and creating todays tensions It was the biggest mistake the West made he said and gradually led to the current situationThese fears about America are likely to worsen in Russia if Hillary Clinton becomes president many people told us she is seen by many Russians especially Russian policymakers as unbendingly hostile to Moscow and bent on the Putin governments destructionHillary is the worst option of any president Fyodor Lukyanov an influential Russian foreign policy expert who edits a leading foreign affairs journal and heads a foreign policy think tank told usMany people here believe that she and her team will try to come back to the line of the 1990s to encourage Russia into an internal transformation Lukyanov added Not by force of course but to encourage some kind of social development that will upend the current system and will promote a new oneWATCH What most people miss about the war in the Ukraine
