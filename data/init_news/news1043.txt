We Are Change In todays political climate even our beer is up for debate And why shouldnt it be This is America We debate things here Thats how democracy works At least when the issues arent taboo Recently its shown up in the state of Pennsylvania with Eric Trump Donald Trumps son garnering an endorsement for the Republican candidate from Yuengling Americas oldest breweryAnd now the debate turns to political actionWith the most recent statement from Richard Dick Yuengling Jr the 73yearold owner of D G Yuengling  Sons located in Pottsville Pennsylvania  the seat of Schuylkill County  Yuengling said that his company was behind Trump Inevitably a lashing out occurred in the digital realm with regard to political correctness and expressively personal views Customers werent pleased They were offended In fact some even claimed that theyd never drink Yuengling againThis is what democracy is and should be Sure And yet something is lost in the politicized scramble of this ugly election yearA Pennsylvania state representative Brian Sims announced on his Facebook page that he was saying GOOD BYE to Yuengling BreweryIm not normally one to call for boycotts but I absolutely believe that how we spend our dollars is a reflection of our votes and values Supporting Yuengling Brewery that uses my dollars to bolster a man and an agenda that wants to punish me for being a member of the LGBT community and punish the black and brown members of my community for not being white is something Im too smart and too grown up to do Sims represents the 182nd district of Philadelphia  which includes a majority of Center City in addition to parts of Rittenhouse Square Grays Ferry and South Philadelphia I live here I walk those areas of the cityAnd I see feel and hear other elements of our society that go unnoticed or receive little to no attention To observe this sort of outcry against a presidential candidate is expectantly what democracy was birthed upon as we know in the city of Philadelphia We take action We like to think However along the way Ive seen the incessant results of many issues that get buried in favor of political expediency and trending topics that ultimately define our aggressive actions towards voting with our dollarsIf thats the case then what about all the other detriments to our standard of living For instance the opiate epidemic that is sweeping Pennsylvania and the surrounding states and the rest of the country by stormAccording to a June 2016 report from the Philadelphia Department of Public Health  entitled The Epidemic of Overdoses From Opioids in Philadelphia drug deaths involving the fatal use of opioids from 20002014 had tripled In 2014 approximately 47000 people died from overdoses in the US according to the Centers for Disease Control  Prevention CDC Sixtyone percent of that total was attributed to the use of opioidsSince 1999 the number of prescriptions for pharmaceutical opioid pain relievers in the US more than quadrupled Opioidrelated overdose deaths in Philadelphia were nearly three times higher in men than among women in 2015 Those deaths were also more than two times as high among whites as opposed to deaths among African AmericansBetween 2003 and 2015 in Philadelphia cocaine and benzodiazepines were detected in overdose deaths in tandem with opioids at a rate of 70 and 90 respectively During that same period overdose deaths related to heroin more than doubled in the city with approximately 400 deaths reported in 2015In that same year there were nearly 700 drug overdose deaths in Philadelphia Thats more than twice as many deaths from homicide in that same yearFrom 20142015 10 of the nearly 1300 overdose deaths in Philadelphia were from nonresidents Most of those nonresidents were people from New Jersey Delaware Maryland and other parts of PennsylvaniaOnce the president is elected these issues wont go away In fact theyre extant  some as a surrogate to the system we attribute to healthcare One of the most hotly contested issues of partisan bickering in the countryAdditionally these effects are increasingly felt in Philadelphia hospitalsThe percentage of Philadelphia hospital emergency department visits related to opioid overdoses increased from approximately 04 in 2007 to nearly 07 in 2015 In 2015 there were over 6500 emergency department visits for opioid overdoses For each opioidrelated death there were approximately 12 hospital emergency department visits So while the country politically corrects itself  whatever that means  myriad issues get buried beneath picking and choosing a side in response to the emotional disturbances of partisan bickeringRather than dealing with facts the web of society becomes entangled with He Said She SaidUltimately this coercive cultural backwardness and evolutionary substandard the rattlemouthed bickering of intellectual thought and deceptive manipulative action that matches up more closely with the reptilian species rather than the spirit of the human heart and the cultural celebration of life and all its wonder is exactly what gave rise to TrumpAnd our opioid epidemicSomewhere along the way the facts were buried beneath the lie And the truth has become something else entirely Sourceshttpwwwphillyvoicecombeerdrinkersdisavowyuenglingafterownershowssupportfortrump The post Political
