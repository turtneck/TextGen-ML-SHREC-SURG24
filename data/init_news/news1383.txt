On The Streets Of Baltimore Trying To Understand The AngerIn the early morning as the cold set in Anaya Maze stood next to the charred remains of a CVS storeHolding a sign she was the only protester left in front of a line of police officers dressed in riot gear She is petite Still she faced the police officers looking at them intentlyA few steps away were the charred skeletons of two police vehicles the victims of an unbridled anger that burned its way through the west side of BaltimoreMaze said she understands the anger For far too long she said police have been killing black men She says Baltimore had this coming All the violence she says might finally change thingsI see no shame in being violent to be heard she said Because if you cant do it peacefully then what other option do you haveLast night after Maryland Gov Larry Hogan had declared a state of emergency and ordered the National Guard into the city rioters still roamed the streets fires still burned and residents still stood on their stoops on their sidewalks trying to understand the anger that boiled over into riotsPierre Thomas 37 was hanging out at the perimeter set up by policeHe said that yes Baltimore has a history of inequality and yes the black community feels forgotten but he didnt agree with setting properties on fireEverybody is angry he said But there is a right and a wrong way to do it I understand why theyre doing it but I dont support it Theyre trashing their own placeA few blocks down Alex who only wanted to be identified by his first name was watching a small corner market burn downHe pointed at the fire trucks that were trying to make their way through the street He pointed at the police officers He said those flames were the only way to get them to come into this part of BaltimoreNobody was calling for peace when Baltimore police officers were beating innocent black men he saidWhere was the peace when we were getting shot Wheres the peace when we were getting laid out Where is the peace when we are in the back of ambulances Where is the peace then They dont want to call for peace then But you know when people really want peace When the white people have to get out of bed when cops have to wear riot gear when the cops start talking about oh we got broken arms Then they want peace he said Peace Its too late for peaceThe police helicopter hovered above and every once in a while we heard the pops of tear gas The flames from the fire got hotter lapping over the roof of a second row houseA woman a few steps away was in tears She was roused from sleep by the smoke Her house is two doors down from the burning market She didnt know if it would survive if the flames would turn all her possessions into ashesThey shouldnt be doing this man We live around here she wailed That was terribleSuddenly as a flame shot into the sky she covered her face and darted off before I could get her name
