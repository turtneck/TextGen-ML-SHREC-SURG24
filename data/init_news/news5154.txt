UPDATE A federal judge has ordered a defiant Kentucky clerk to jail after she refused to issue marriage licenses to gay couplesUS District Judge David Bunning told Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis she would be jailed until she complied with his order to issue the licenses Davis said thank you before she was led out of the courtroom by a US marshal She was not in handcuffsBunning also warned deputy clerks around the state that they could suffer the same fate should they refuse to issue marriage licenses to gay couplesDavis has refused to issue marriages licenses for two months since the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage She argues that her Christian faith should exempt her from signing the licensesLiberty Counsel attorney Mat Staver who is representing Davis called the ruling outrageousIf this country has come to this point where a judge jails someone like Kim Davis for their religious convictions  then we have lost our religious liberty Staver told meHe said Davis will be fingerprinted and photographed just like a criminalThis cannot be tolerated he said This is ultimately going to spark a huge debate around the country This is not the kind of country  this is not the America that our founders envisionedThe Associated Press contributed to this reportKim Davis could become the first Christian in America jailed as a result of the Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriageIve weighed the cost and Im prepared to go to jail I sure am Mrs Davis told me in an exclusive interview This has never been a gay or lesbian issue for me This is about upholding the word of GodThis is a heaven or hell issue for me and for every other Christian that believes she said This is a fight worth fightingClick here to join Todds American Dispatch a MUSTREAD for ConservativesDavis is the clerk of Rowan County Ky  a small patch of earth in the northeastern part of the state She was elected last November  taking the place of her mother who held the position for nearly 40 yearsIts fair to say that issuing marriage licenses was something of a family business  until the day the Supreme Court legalized gay marriageDavis is a devout Apostolic Christian and she knew that should gay marriage become legal she could not and would not sign her name on a samesex marriage certificateI would have to either make a decision to stand or I would have to buckle down and leave she said pondering her choices And if I left resigned or chose to retire I would have no voice for Gods wordSo when that day came she issued an edict No more marriage licenses would be issued in Rowan County It was a decision that would bring down the wrath of militant LGBT activists and their supportersThey told my husband they were going to burn us down while we slept in our home she said Hes been told that he would be beaten up and tied up and made to watch them rape me I have been told that gays should kill meLiberty Counsel the public interest law firm that represents Davis says forcing her to issue samesex marriage licenses violates her religious beliefsBut the courts dont seem interested in that argumentA federal judge ordered her to issue the licenses an appeals court upheld that decision and the US Supreme Court declined to intervene Should Davis continue to defy the law she could be fined or sent to jailNo matter what the court decides Davis says she will not violate her religious beliefs  and she will not resign her postIm very steadfast in what I believe she told me I dont leave my conscience and my Christian soul out in my vehicle and come in here and pretend to be something Im not Its easy to talk the talk but can you walk the walkThe mainstream media and the activists have been ruthless Theyve portrayed her as a monster  a rightwing homophobic hypocrite Shes been smeared by tabloidstyle reports on her checkered past Theyve written extensively about her failed marriagesIts true shes been married four times But whats missing in the mainstream media coverage is the context Her life was radically changed by Jesus Christ in 2011 and since then she has become a different personMy God in heaven knows every crack every crevice every deep place in my heart she said And he knows the thoughts that are in my mind before I even think them And he has given me such a beautiful and wonderful grace through all of thisShe once lived for the devil but now she lives for God Shes a sinner saved by graceI had created such a pit of sin for myself with my very own hands she told meSo how does she handle the reporters and talking heads who call her a hypocriteAll I can say to them is if they have a sordid past like what I had they too can receive the cleansing and renewing and they can start a fresh life and they can be different she said They dont have to remain in their sin theres hope for tomorrowDavis did not seek the national spotlight She had no intention of becoming a spokeswoman for religious liberty and she bristles at the idea that she is a hero of the faithIm just a vessel God has chosen for this time and this place she said Im no different than any other Christian It was my appointed time to stand and their time will comeTodd Starnes
