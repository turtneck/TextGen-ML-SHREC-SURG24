Critics say the shock of congressional rejection of the nuclear deal is a path to bring Iran back to the negotiating table Secretary of State John Kerry calls that view a fantasySecretary of State John Kerry listens while testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee on the impacts of the nuclear deal with Iran on Capitol Hill WednesdayThe television ads are airing across the country from Washington to Honolulu The Iran nuclear deal is a bad deal the ad says before concluding We want a better dealAs Congress debates the complex international agreement limiting Irans nuclear program in anticipation of a September vote the option of rejecting this deal in favor of a better deal appears to be catching on On Wednesday Rep Grace Meng D of New York announced she would oppose the deal on the table believing the world could and should have a better dealBut what is the likelihood that an agreement negotiated over several years between six world powers and Iran could indeed be renegotiated and toughened up if Congress rejects the current deal and overcomes a promised presidential vetoThe deep divisions over that question come down more than anything to peoples perception of Iran whether or not it is a country the United States should be entangled with in such a complex deal whether or not it should be allowed to possess any uranium enrichment program at allCritics of the Iran deal say there is plenty of historical precedent for renegotiating and amending international agreements They argue that Iran is so intent on getting a deal with the US that Tehran could be brought back to the negotiating table after the shock of a congressional rejectionThere is an alternative to the current deal it is an amended deal says Mark Dubowitz an international sanctions expert and executive director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies FDD in WashingtonCiting nearly 80 multilateral agreements Congress has either rejected or for which it has required amendments he says Congress should require the administration to renegotiate certain terms of the proposed deal and resubmit the amended agreement to CongressBut senior administration officials involved in the Iran negotiations say there is no chance the deal could be renegotiated  and they warn that instead of tighter controls on Irans nuclear program rejection of the deal would very likely result in a rampedup uranium enrichment program That in turn would mean a shrinking breakout time for Iran to rush to produce a nuclear weapon if it chose to they addCalling the prospect of a better deal a fantasy Secretary of State John Kerry told senators last week that those demanding a renegotiated deal including in the TV ads hed seen were proffering some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Irans complete capitulation  something he said is not going to happenSome nonproliferation experts echo that position saying the Iranian nuclear program was already too advanced years ago to reduce it any more than what the deal reached July 14 doesSure Id like a better deal  Id like a pony too but its not realistic says Jeffrey Lewis director of nonproliferation studies at the MiddleburyInstitute of International Studies at Monterey Calif The most important thing now is to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon in the next 10 to 15 years and this deal does thatOthers are much less certain the deal blocks Irans paths to a nuclear weapon but they believe a renegotiated deal couldFDDs Mr Dubowitz says he sees three different directions the Iran nuclear issue could take if Congress rejects the current deal and holds out for an agreement renegotiated on better termsIran could go ahead and implement its commitments under the deal he says Itcould alsoabandon its commitments and escalate it nuclear program Or it could try to do both complying with certain commitments while abandoning others  and thus attempt to divide world powers while advancing its nuclear programBut under any of those scenarios Dubowitz says the US could work to persuade the Europeans to join the US in demanding a renegotiation of key parts of the dealYet many regional experts say that prospects for wooing the Europeans to join the US in pressing for a tougher deal if Congress rejects the one now before it are dimEuropean and Asian partners would feel frustrated and misled in the wake of a US rejection of the deal Jon Alterman a Middle East expert at Washingtons Center for Strategic and International Studies told the House Armed Services Committee this week European allies would likely join countries like China and India in investing in Irans energy sector he addedBroadly the action would create distance between the US and the world and diminish distance between Iran and the world Dr Alterman added after more than a decade when the reverse was the caseLooming large over the calls for a return to negotiations are strong suspicions on the part of deal supporters that the better deal advocates really have no interest in a stronger deal at all but instead want to thwart any US agreement with the Iranian governmentWe had a better deal in Iraq after 1991 following the Gulf War there were no restrictions inspectors could go where they wanted when they wanted and that deal wasnt good enough says Dr Lewis adding that we still went to war So really I dont believe them when they say they just want a better deal this timeOther doubters of the sincerity of the seekers of a better deal say its telling to note that the sponsor of the TV ad campaign demanding a better deal is a group called Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran which is backed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee a proIsrael organization lobbying Congress hard for the deals defeatThere really is no better deal for such critics in the sense of an agreement that leaves any nuclear program in the hands of the current Iranian government Lewis says Any deal is bad because it means living with the Islamic Republic
