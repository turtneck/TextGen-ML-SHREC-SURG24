ISIS the world understands is a violent jihadist group driven by twisted religious devotion and its dream of radical Islamist conquest ISISs own members understand the group that way But what if theyre wrong What if ISIS is not a spontaneous religious movement but rather was constructed by a shadowy group of secular military leaders to fulfill their secret agendaExplosive new documentsuncovered by Der Spiegels Christoph Reuter published on Saturdayreveal that there is a dark secret at the heart of ISISIt was not radical Islamists who conceived and created ISIS they suggest but rather a small group of senior Iraqi officers in Saddam Husseins brutal police state Their plan appears to have been to use ISIS to reconquer Iraq For them jihadism was simply a means to the end of retaking the country they had lost a counterattack to the 2003 USled invasion that toppled them from powerDer Spiegel says ituncovered the documents from a house in Syria that was used by a former Iraqi military intelligence official who before he was killed in a 2014 firefight went by the name Haji Bakr The documents show the blueprint for the creation of the Islamic State written before the group became what it is today and executed to detail While we have known for some time that former officers in Saddams military were working with ISIS  they shared a Sunni background and a hatred of the new Americaninstalled government these documents suggest the officers were far more involved in planning and launching the Islamic State than previously thoughtAs Der Spiegels stunning investigation found ISIS was organized in much the same way as Saddams police state Haji Bakrs goal was to use the chaos and extremism of the Syrian war to build up this new group in Syria giving it a beachhead from which it could invade and conquer much of Iraq Once there it would set up an intricate and Orwellian system of control in the mold of Saddams IraqISIS in other words would replace one totalitarianism with another Though Saddams Iraq had been Sunni and secular and ISISs Iraq would be Sunni and Islamist this same group of former Saddam officials would remain at the top For Haji Bakr and the other officers working with him the groups apocalyptic jihadism would simply be a vehicle for their return to powerThere is a simple reason why there is no mention in Bakrs writings of prophecies relating to the establishment of an Islamic State allegedly ordained by God He believed that fanatical religious convictions alone were not enough to achieve victory But he did believe that the faith of others could be exploited In 2010 Bakr and a small group of former Iraqi intelligence officers made Abu Bakr alBaghdadi the emir and later caliph the official leader of the Islamic State They reasoned that Baghdadi an educated cleric would give the group a religious face Haji Bakr was a nationalist not an Islamist says Iraqi journalist Hisham alHashimiBakrs journey from serving in a violently secular regime to helping found a violently Islamist group began in 2003 after the USled invasion of Iraq One of Americas first decisions on taking Iraq  a terrible mistake that has haunted the region ever since  was to disband Iraqs enormous army leaving its officers and soldiers with no income Haji Bakr was left bitter and unemployed a source who knew him told Der Spiegel as were many officers like himThis speaks to a terrible irony of the 2003 Americanled invasion of Iraq The war was premised in part on the assertion that Saddams regime was linked to antiAmerican jihadist terrorists This was a falsehood But the invasion made this falsehood true  and in more terrible fashion than we ever imagined possibleHaji Bakr desperate after 2003 to defeat the Americans and the new Shiamajority government fought alongside Sunni extremists in Iraq Later he began constructing ISIS As Der Spiegels investigation found he was able to use his knowledge of running an oppressive security state to build up ISIS into more than just another jihadist groupBakr had something else that proved essential deep contacts with Syrian leader Bashar alAssads military and intelligence services This allowed him to arrange the unofficial alliance of convenience between ISIS and Assad as the two tacitly tolerate one another in Syria and fight their mutual enemies thereAs Der Spiegels Reuter writes there are unmistakable parallels in the architectures of ISIS and of Saddams Iraq The two systems ultimately shared a conviction that control over the masses should lie in the hands of a small elite that should not be answerable to anyone he writes The secret of ISISs success lies in the combination of opposites the fanatical beliefs of one group and the strategic calculations of the other
