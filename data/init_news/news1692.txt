This post was originally published on this site The concept of evolution should not be limited to the scientific assertions around Darwins theory of natural selection but ought to include the more general idea that people and processes constantly evolve in response to the forces that surround them We evolve from childhood into adulthood and ideally from selfcenteredness toward the good of larger entities like our community or nation and now faced with climate change the good of our planet Political arrangements have evolved from the divine right of kings into stillevolving democratic systems A Supreme Court justices orientation toward evolution in this basic sense determines whether he or she is a strict originalist a nicer word for fundamentalist or sees the Constitution as a living document that must be responsive to changing conditions No founding father composing the second amendment could have foreseen the surfeit of guns decimating our country today Such evolutionary processes are alive dynamic an unstoppable juggernaut pervading every aspect of reality Against them even the determination not to evolve has evolutionary effects as we have seen in the bizarre presidential process of the past year A Neanderthal candidate has helped awaken a generation of young women and ideally young men also to evolve beyond being victims of crude chauvinist stereotypes The whole cosmos has been evolving for 138 billion years from energy to matter to here on earth life and selfconscious life Evolution is the context of our reality the story all humans share This story is beginning to seep into collective consciousness in a way that may yet render obsolete divisions such as those between Shia and Sunni let alone between radical Islamic fundamentalism and the postEnlightenment West We all evolved from the same mysterious source Every differentiation in that largest context by race tribe religion ethnicity feels arbitrary and abstract It is not surprising that fundamentalism in whatever form has often found the evolutionary paradigm threatening because it implies a challenging dynamic of change that feels insecure For many believers to generalize unfairly religion provides behavioral rules that can be a source of security and comfort even as they are used as excuses to remain exclusive and resist evolving Within each world religion there are minority enclaves the Sufis in Islam Zen practitioners of Buddhism Catholic mystics like Teilhard de Chardin who understand that their spiritual discipline is an opportunity to evolve toward inclusivity toward looking within at fears and projections rather than looking outward for enemies and toward expanding our identifications and responsibilities beyond the national to the planetary Far from being a benign feelgood process evolution is often painful one step forward two back Take the tortured but necessary demise of the American coal industry No one wants to see the debilitating effects of unemployment on real people with real families but so far the technology of coal burning hasnt evolved a way not to accelerate global warming We humans are supposedly not built to respond effectively to longterm threats like changes in climate but late in the game as it is we do seem to be collectively learning what is at stake and evolving locally and globally Entrepreneurs are rapidly bringing to market solar wind and other cleaner and more sustainable energy sources Unfortunately negative and harmful processes can also become subject to an evolutionary juggernaut Since 1945 weapons systems have evolved more accurately we have evolved them to a level of complexity and destructive power that we are already powerless to control The Pentagon is reported to be spending its usual vast sums on research into computercontrolled robotic drones capable of making their own autonomous decisions about who is an enemy The defense establishments of other great nations are presumably up to the same mischief or soon will be because the arms race never stops evolving Or wont until we embrace a new way of thinking that we must evolve to survive We we the nations are hopelessly complacent in our present reliance upon deterrence as a workable security system As the fellow falling from the hundredth floor said as he passed the sixtieth so far so good The system an emperor with no clothes solemnly worshipped by legions of selfconfident experts is too complex not to be subject to breakdown at any moment perhaps by accident perhaps where NATO and Russia push up against each other in Eastern Europe perhaps in Kashmir The threat of nuclear extinction provides a new context for the obsolete parochialism of the worlds major religions If this threat isnt enough to accelerate the ecumenical impulse what is As people of diverse spiritual worldviews acknowledge that they have in common the possibility of annihilation our shared anxiety can energize evolution toward inclusivity and nonviolent solutions to conflict The world is in a race between fundamentalists and arms manufacturers on the one hand and evolutionaries who see clearly both the futile deadend of the arms race and the possibility of a security built upon the truth of interdependence which appears in similar form in all the religions as the Golden Rule We will live together or die together As we treat others so we will be treated Whether they each understand this or not this is the hiddeninplainsight background behind the TrumpClinton mudwrestle Will the arms manufacturers and the politicians in league with them evolve in the face of the nuclear threat in a way similar to our positive responses to the challenge of climate instability I live in Maine where the states largest private employer is the Bath Iron Works They are building three of a new kind of guided missile destroyer that is contoured to hide from radar Each one costs 4 billion dollars Recently I had a conversation with an Iron Works employee I made the assumption that given his job he would be hawkishly supportive of a robust military Not at all His exact parting words were Id be much happier
