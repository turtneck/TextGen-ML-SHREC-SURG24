Trump proposals that seem startling now  such as killing terrorists spouses  might be less so after years of a Trump administration political experts sayRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump waves to the crowd over the heads of media photographers as he arrives to speak at a campaign rally on June 11 2016 at a private hangar at Greater Pittsburgh International Airport in Moon PaDonald Trumps presidential campaign has been extraordinary in many ways But one of its most unprecedented  some would say shocking  aspects is the way the blustery billionaire keeps promising to do things that are likely beyond the limits of presidential authority set by the Constitution of the United StatesHis supporters thrill to Mr Trumps promise of raw power of course Tearing up treaties torturing terrorists threatening Muslims  all are huge applause lines at Trump rallies President Obama is already stretching the legal bounds of his office many Republicans insist Trump would be just going Democrats one betterBut others think Trumps talk raises important questions about the extent to which he could threaten American law and democratic norms The most likely change might not involve outandout authoritarianism as much as a coarsening of acceptable US political behavior Trump proposals that seem startling now  such as killing terrorists spouses  might be less so after years of a Trump administrationWhat would be activated would be a normalization of certain kind of things  The law might not change but the attitude would says Andrew Rudalevige a professor of government at Bowdoin College in Brunswick Maine and author of The New Imperial PresidencyMany of Trumps more outrageous proposals involve enemies perceived and realTake the media Please as Trump might paraphrase Henny Youngman Trump who has barred organizations such as The Washington Post and Politico from covering his campaign events after coverage he deemed unfair has promised to loosen libel laws to make it easier to sue media companies Never mind the First Amendment or that Congress is the body of government that actually writes lawsThen theres US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel who is overseeing a pair of class action lawsuits charging the defunct Trump University with fraud Trumps personal and racial attacks on the USborn judge show a high degree of disregard for judicial independence say critics especially his insistence that somebody should look into Curiels background If elected how will Trump deal with losses in personal business or executive branch litigationTrumps been particularly bombastic about what hed do in terms of national security He insists hed target the wives and children of terrorists  a deliberate killing of civilian bystanders Former CIA director Michael Hayden has said that if Trump orders such action the US military would likely refuse setting off a dispute that could spiral into a constitutional crisis Trump has also said numerous times that he would reinstitute waterboarding of terror suspects or worseThats a really troubling thing Waterboarding is torture pretty clear And if waterboarding is torture it violates criminal law says Chris Edelson an assistant professor of government at American University in Washington and author of Power Without Constraint The Post 911 Presidency and National SecurityAs for Trumps proposed ban on Muslim immigrants entering the US that may  or may not  pass constitutional muster Traditionally the executive branch has broad latitude to set immigration regulations However the Supreme Court might look askance at a ban on a particular religious group even if applied to people outside the US according to Professor Edelson Its uncharted legal territory And Congress might weigh in After all GOP lawmakers from House Speaker Paul Ryan on down have said they oppose such a banTrump could try to act against Congress but that would put him on a weak footing notes EdelsonTrumps bombast has put many of his nominal Republican supporters in a difficult position For years GOP lawmakers been accusing Mr Obama of abusing his office and bypassing the will of Congress and now their partys presumptive presidential nominee is promising to go even fartherIn response some have taken the position that Trump will inevitably be restrained by existing checks on presidential power both legislative and judicial His staff will curb his enthusiasm for things he really cant do Hell have a White House counsel says Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellWell maybe The job of a White House counsel isnt primarily to point out the limits of presidential authority Its to figure out legal justifications for things presidents already want to do says Professor Rudalevige of BowdoinThat should not be a surprise Theyre lawyers and the president is their client Even if they conclude something cant be done the government has lots and lots of other legal offices The Oval Office can pick and choose the opinion it likes bestAs to legislative and judicial checks on presidential power those are not automatic If a president oversteps their bounds much would depend on what the people who staff those branches of government decide to doThe Constitution does not enforce itself says Edelson of American UniversityThat in turn could depend on the domestic political and international security situation facing the nation at that moment Consider World War II President Franklin Roosevelt facing a grave threat decided that it would be OK to go ahead and imprison JapaneseAmericans in internment camps He issued an executive order to that effectToday that seems pretty clearly unconstitutional and it probably did then too But most US citizens accepted it due to the nature of the timesThats the civil liberties danger associated with national security fears Power flows to the Oval Office and when the danger is passed not all of that power flows backSince 911 the presidency has changed argues Edelson President George W Bush pioneered sweeping surveillance powers some of which have since been enacted into law Obama has intensified a nominally secret drone war that includes the extrajudicial killing of American citizens deemed to be terrorists The next president will inherit that war intactThis increase in presidential security power will be an issue whoever wins the presidency says Edelson Its not specific to Trump or presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary ClintonThe reality is we shouldnt trust anyone with unlimited power he saysAs for Trump if he wins the White House in the fall he can argue that voters have approved his many proposals He has made no secret of how he would move to try and deport the millions of unauthorized immigrants currently living in the US He has broadly hinted that he considers all Muslims in America complicit in some manner with Islamic Stateinspired domestic terrorist attacks It would be of a piece for Trump to propose heightened scrutiny for Muslims in the USIn that case the US would still be a democracy But it might not still be a liberal democracy according to Shadi Hamid a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution in WashingtonBy liberal democracy Mr Hamid does not mean a government leftish on the political spectrum but one that respects broadly recognized personal rights and freedoms Under Trump the US might become an illiberal democracy according to Hamid a place where a majority has voted to restrict the personal rights of a minority or minoritiesRegardless of the final election outcome  the billionaires rise offers up a powerful  and frightening  reminder that liberal democracy even where its entrenched is a fragile thing Hamid writes
