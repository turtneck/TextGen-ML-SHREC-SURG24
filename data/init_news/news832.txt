entirely on lies andgiven the USs hegemonic position in the world allowing it to act with impunitythe crimes architects have never punished 1 The principal achievement of the war and occupation was the dramatic expansion of the alQaeda network that had attacked the US on January 11 2001 An alQaeda franchise was established in Iraq for the first time playing a key role in the Sunni insurrection against the occupiers and their Shiite allies then expanding across the border into Syria where it split into the alNusra affiliate and its even more savage rival ISIL Iraq also served and serves as a training ground for jihadis now operating from Iraq to Libya and beyond 2 The invasion and its consequences encouraged the cause of Kurdistan  an imagined state straddling Iran Iraq Syria and Turkey The Kurds are the largest stateless people in the world victims of British and French colonialists who divided the region between them after World War I After the Gulf War of 1991 the US established a nofly zone over northern Iraq to discourage Baghdad from deploying troops in the region Iraqi Kurdistan had already obtained a degree of autonomy before the invasion but the status became official under the occupation and a referendum for independence is likely to pass soon This would infuriate Iraq and perhaps provoke Turkeys intervention As it is the autonomous region is locked in struggle with Baghdad over territorial claims and control over oil fields 3 The invasion destroyed the Iraqi state  causing it to fracture into three Kurdistan the Sunni zone in the west and the Shiitemajority areas around Baghdad The Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein had been extremely repressive and brutal But it had maintained order discouraged religion in politics protected the Christian and other religious minorities promoted womens rights imposed no dress code enforced a criminal code modeled after the Napoleonic not the Sharia licensed rock n roll radio stations allowed the brewing of beer and its sale etc The Shiiteled regime boosted into power by the occupation has reversed much of this A bill to ban the production and sale of beer was just passed by Parliament last week But the regimes power does not extend into much of Anbar Province ISIL still governs Mosul and again Kurdistan has become autonomous 4 Because Shiites are the majority in Iraq 60 and dominate Iran next door and because the leaders of Shiite parties have studied in Iran or lived their in exile and are sympathetic to Irans mullahled regime and because the US was forced by peaceful mass protests to allow elections and the emergence of Shiites as the leaders of the country Irans power and influence in the region has expanded dramatically Apparently no one in the State Department thought about that Since Iran has not attacked another country in centuriesbut was savagely attacked by Saddam Hussein in 1981 sparking a long war killing over half a million peopleand since Irans friendliness to its neighbor one of the few Arab countries in which its cocoreligionists hold power is entirely natural one can ask why anyone might be alarmed by this But it does alarm some the leaders of Saudi Arabia that crucial US Arab ally governed by Wahhabi Sunnis most of all 5 The invasion produced a regional power struggle between Sunni Islamists on the one hand and their Shiite and other enemies on the other This is often portrayed as a contest between Saudi Arabia whose governmentbacked clerics condemn Shiites as heretics and who fear the prospects for rebellion in Saudi Arabias own oppressed Shiite minority and Iran depicted as the protector of Shiites in Syria Lebanon Yemen etc The socalled Shiite Crescent extending from Iran to Hizbollahcontrolled areas of Lebanon in fact embraces states and movements that have little in common with the Islamic Republic of Iran But they are all targeted by the medieval regime in Riyadh which tars them all with the Iranian brush The Saudis were keen advocates for a US strike on Iran on the false pretext of a nuclear threat are major supporters of alNusra in Syria and have funded ISIL as well preferring such Islamist forces to the secular if Alawiteled Syrian regime and are bombing the hell out of Yemen with active US and British assistance under the false pretext that the Shiite Houthi rebels are agents for an expanding Iran These things would not be happening had the US not ripped the lid off Pandoras box in Iraq in March 2003 6 The invasion has produced friction between the US and its important NATO ally Turkey which has the second largest military in the alliance Turkish war planes are bombing Kurdish YPG Peoples Protection Units militia in Syria who constitute the USs most reliable allies producing US protests which the Turks ignore arguing straightfaced that the YPG are just as terrorist as ISIL The Turks warned before the invasion of Iraq that it would likely produce regional instability But Ankara would have allowed the US to attack from Turkish soil if Turkish forces as part of the coalition of the willing could be stationed around Mosul once part of Turkeythe idea being to contain Kurdish nationalism Fortunately the parliament rejected the deal But the predicted instability has occurred The Arab Spring of 2011 in Syria was not directly connected to the Iraq invasion but gave the US the opportunity to pontificate that Assad has lost legitimacy demand his immediate resignation and bankroll the armed opposition including the Kurds The fact that US efforts to find and recruit Syrian Arab forces as allieswho are not in bed with alNusrato topple Assad have failed so dismally binds the Pentagon ever closer to forces that Turkey wants to wipe out The conflict and contradiction are embarrassing to Washington Oh by the way did you notice that the Turkish foreign minister just announced that Turkey would invade Iraq if it felt threatened Having declared in 2011 that Bashar alAssad must go the US was faced in 2014 with the horrible embarrassment of ISIL that toxic fruit of its Iraq invasion winning lightening victories from Raqqa to Fallujah obliterating the SykesPicot line dividing Syria and Iraq The nowSyria based terrorists were approaching Baghdad So now the US having withdrawn all troops in Iraq was back in action bombing to prevent such a disaster And it started bombing ISIL positions in Syria although with far less efficacy than the later Russian efforts in league with a list of largely reluctant allies dragooned into formal membership in what Washington likes to call a coalition to make its unilateral program for the region sound like the will of what they like to call the international community regardless of how many key nations that imagined community includes The US command that Assad step down was made in the summer of 2011 Turkeys President Erdogan hitherto a friend and even mentor of the Syrian leader opportunistically took up the US demand and demanded his resignation And Ankara itself began to interfere bigtime in the neighboring country it once dominated targeting Kurds more than anyone else Since the US relies on these allies how could there not be a sharp conflict here 7 The invasion of Iraq and aftermath resulted in four million Iraqi refugees fleeing the country as of 2007 Hundreds of thousands have poured into Europe alongside people displaced by US wars in Afghanistan and Libya and by the turmoil in Syria exacerbated by US actions producing a massive continentwide crisis Many Europeans aptly blame the deluge on the US pointing to the USs paltry record of admitting refugees from the Middle East and complaining of strained national resources to handle the humanitarian catastrophe Another embarrassment  This is all what Buddhists call karmic retribution for past acts Or what the Hebrew prophet Hosea referred to when he said Those who sow the wind reap the whirlwind Or what the CIA meant when it invented the term blowback Its all heading towards something unless decent people stop it But when I watch people like Michael Moore line up behind the foremost advocate of war in US politics joining consciously philosophical amoral thugs hellbent on maintaining and expanding the empire when its in a stage of precipitous decline I am not optimistic Not only will she win but she will rival Dick Cheney as a coldblooded latterday Cold Warrior cynically exploiting fear and stupidity to try to bring Russia to its knees Hillary doesnt recognize any of these seven points which to recapitulate are  US actions have greatly strengthened alQaeda  US actions have encouraged Kurdish nationalism with unpredictable ramifications  The US through its vicious illegal actions has destroyed the modern Iraqi state  US actions have solidified ties between Iran and Iraqs majority Shiite community strengthening a country still targeted for regime change  The invasion of Iraq and the regime change there exacerbated the historical SunniShiite divide and encouraged Saudi Arabia as the ultraIslamist protector of the shrines to redouble its efforts to support extremist Sunnis everywhere in the region  The results of the invasion place Turkey and the US at loggerheads over the question of Kurdish nationalist movements in both Iraq and Syria  US interventions in the Middle East and North Africa since 2001 have produced a massive refugee crisis inflicted mainly on Europe She does not acknowledge that George W Bushs invasion that she so passionately endorsed fully exposing her Valkyrie soul was criminal and not somebodys wellmeaning mistake She doesnt have any analysis of the Kurdish question She is notas sometimes alleged by supportersa policy wonk but a lazy intellect who doesnt know jackshit about the real world She has never expressed regret for the horrific destruction of Iraq nor given any attention to the plight of its women who were as she surely knows much better off under Saddam Hussein To acknowledge that would be to suggest that sometimes US imperialism favors misogynist Islamists over relatively progressive secularists for its own pragmatic empirebuilding purposes She cant mention that publicly She deals with the rise of Iranmade inevitable by the US invasion of Iraqby doubling down on her crude clueless Iran rhetoric which rests on the assumptionrepeatedly debunked by US intelligence agenciesthat Iran might pose a nuclear weapons threat She doesnt understand the history of the SunniShiite divide I believe she rolls her eyes in irritation that these people have these differences so hard to understand impeding the Exceptional Nations ability to straighten everything out by bombing and conquering and making people die She doesnt understand anything about the history of the Kurds and their fate in the region She feels no guilt at all about her orchestration of the ruin of Libya She sees no reason to link her own actions to the flooding of Europe with refugees fleeing terror But she will probably be the next president with fellow shieldmaidens Michele Flournoy as secretary of defense and Victoria Nuland or Samantha Power as secretary of state Never acknowledging what happened yesterday never able to absorb historical lessons determined to maintain and expend its global hegemony just as that becomes absolutely impossible to do because other nations rise too and great nations like Spain and Britain actually get humbled over time the US under Clinton will likely head methodically towards a showdown with Russia She wants so badly to show she can do it Shell do it for women everywhere to show how strong a woman can be And then there will be a sudden strange change in your environment As you wonder whats going on youll be painlessly vaporized on account of Hillarys passion to topple Assad or forcibly reintegrate the Donbass into Ukraine The brilliance of the 2003 invasion will be clarified as never before in that bright blast as Hillarya very strong womancackles in the background from her bunker about how she came saw and a million died
