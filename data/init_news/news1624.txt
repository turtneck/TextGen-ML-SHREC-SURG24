The Yale Record Just Published The BEST NonEndorsement Of A Candidate EVER By Marty Townsend on October 27 2016 Subscribe The Yale Record  Americas Oldest College Humor Magazine has NOT endorsed Hillary Clinton  in a most spectacular way The Yale Record is based in the college town of New Haven Connecticut and was founded by Edward Anthony Bradford  James Heartt VanBuren  Samuel J Elder  EH Lemis  and Henry Ward Beecher Howard in 1872 publishing their first weekly issue on September 11 1872 They gleefully point readers to their lengthy Wikipedia page to prove their validity claim the invention of the word hot dog and ponder whether the face of the New Yorker would look different if they hadnt been doing what theyre doing The Record adopted Old Owl as their mascot over a century ago but the actual date of acquisition wasnt recorded anywhere The mascot  described as a connoisseur of Cutty Sark  is  a congenial largely nocturnal 360degreeheadturning cigarsmoking bird who tries to steer the staff towards a lighthearted appreciation of life and the finer things in it From Wikimedia Commons available under a CC AttributionShareAlike 30 Unported license With such an illustrious past how could anything they produce not be spectacular Lets see what Old Owl had to say The nonendorsement begins with a simple explanation of why they arent endorsing any candidate In its 144year history The Yale Record has never endorsed a Democratic candidate for president In fact we have never endorsed any candidate for president This is in part due to our strong commitment to being a taxexempt 501c3 organization which mandates that we are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for elective public office And The Yale Record believes both candidates to be equally unendorsable due to our faithful compliance with the tax code With that explained one would ordinarily assume they were done But no they had a bit more to say  In particular we do not endorse Hillary Clintons exemplary leadership during her 30 years in the public eye We do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this countrya commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career Because of unambiguous tax law we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern American history nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing Secretary Clinton on November 8 The Yale Record has no opinion whatsoever on Dr Jill Stein So there it is absolutely the best nonendorsement EVER Featured image courtesy of Heat Street  About Marty Townsend Active in Michigan with several groups and organizations including the National Action Network NAN Occupy Detroit Save Michigan Public Schools Dearborn PTA Council Michigan Petitioners and several other small groups working together to make Michigan a better place Concentrates on educational issues but also covers human interest liberal politics Michigan environmental issues and Detroit including the fight against Emergency Managers the Education Achievement Authority and fighting the corporate takeover of Michigan and the United States Buy me a a href cup of coffee Connect
