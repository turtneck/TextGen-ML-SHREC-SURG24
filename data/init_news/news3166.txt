Governors position on gay marriage may reflect and effort to preserve opportunity to run for president in 2016As activists push states to recognize gay marriages New Jersey Gov Chris Christie  conservative Republican governor in a blue state and a 2016 presidential possibility  is walking a fine line between two electorates and two electionsChristie vetoed samesex marriage legislation last year and severely criticized the Supreme Courts decision striking down a ban on federal rights for samesex married couples At the same time he is adamant that samesex couples deserve equal legal protection wants a referendum on gay marriage and vows to abide by a samesex marriage law if the voters approve itHes tiptoeing between constituencies First are the voters of New Jersey polls show they favor samesex marriage and Christie wants them to reelect him in November by a big margin Then there are Republican caucusgoers in Iowa Christie needs their backing if he runs for president in 2016 in 2012 evangelical conservatives who generally oppose gay marriage made up 57 of Republican caucusgoers in the state according to exit pollsAnd there is a third group of voters to think about swing voters across the nation who might go for a Republican presidential nominee who is sufficiently centristTo appeal to those voters Christie will want to not be perceived to be as far right as many Republicans are says David Boaz of the Cato Institute a libertarian think tank Thats a lot of tightropes to walkChristie who is Roman Catholic has said he does not believe being gay is a choice nor is it a sin and that he has gay friends who argue the issue with him Marriage he said last year on CNN is special and unique in society He followed his veto in of the gaymarriage bill in February 2012 with a call for a statewide referendum on whether to allow samesex marriage by constitutional amendmentWhen you want to change the core of a 2000 yearold institution the way to do that is to put it in front of the voters he told reporters July 2A referendum would allow samesex marriage to pass in New Jersey without his fingerprints  or as he said at a townhallstyle meeting last month I dont have to compromise my principles that I believe in and someone else doesnt have to compromise theirsChristie is in the same position as his party The Republican platform says marriage is only for couples of different sexes but Chairman Reince Priebus has said that the Republican Party should be open to those who favor samesex marriage I dont believe we need to act like Old Testament heretics he told USA TODAY in March Instead Republicans have to strike a balance between principle and grace and respectGarden State Equality a leading advocate for samesex marriage in New Jersey opposes a referendum saying civil rights should not be on the ballot It should never be up to the majority to vote on the rights of the minority spokesman TJ Helmstetter saidSamesex marriage advocates are now lobbying New Jersey legislators to override Christies veto before the end of the year when the window to do so expires Christie is too powerful a party leader to let that happen says Ben Dworkin director of Rider Universitys Rebovich Institute for New Jersey PoliticsI cant envision a situation where the Republican votes that are needed to get the twothirds override would come given this administrations history Dworkin says The Christie administration sees no reason why any Republican should really ever override a Republican governor Thats their logic so Id be shocked if it ever got to happenLast year Christie nominated a gay judge a Republican to the state Supreme Court a first for the state Last month when the Supreme Court ruled on Defense of Marriage Act he called it insulting to the Congress and president which passed the lawTroy Stevenson executive director of Garden State Equality said I dont like to pretend I can get inside the mind of the governor but I think the closer we get to him having future political ambitions the more staunch his opposition gets to marriage equalityBut Jimmy LaSalvia a founder of GOProud a Republican gayrights group that favors samesex marriage gives Christie credit for not trying to change the subject Hes one Republican who doesnt say I believe marriage is between a man and a woman We need jobs and the economy is hurting says LaSalvia who now works with the ACLU trying to pass samesex marriage state by state Hes willing to talk through the issue in a way that no other Republican has the balls to doChristie has to make his political calculus now even though he doesnt know how much public opinion will change between now and 2016 Boaz says Will people be more liberal then Is the country Yes But the Republican primary electorate maybe not so muchPublic opinion on gay marriage has changed rapidly Four years ago 37 of Americans favored samesex marrage Now 51 do according to the Pew Research CenterIowa and New Hampshire traditionally the first states to hold presidential nominating contests both allow samesex marriage  which could mean voters there no longer focus on it as an issue Those people in those states have been living with samesex marriage for a while LaSalvia says I dont think any of us knows how the issue is going to play in 2016 because its moving so fast An October poll sponsored by the Iowa Republican a news site showed Iowans favor gay marriage 49 to 42Iowa has allowed gays to marry since a 2009 state Supreme Court decision  and voters remain conflicted about it says pollster Ann Selzer who conducts the Iowa Poll for the Des Moines Register You ask them on the street and nobody can say that their lives have been affected But you ask them if they like it and they dont In a poll taken a month after the 2012 caucuses 64 of Republicans favored a constitutional amendment banning samesex marriage
