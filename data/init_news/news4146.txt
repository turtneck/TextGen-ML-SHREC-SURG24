By The Voice of Reason  In recent weeks a common theme that has run through the vast majority of the stories Ive covered has been for people to make sure they are preparing for the possibility of a major emergency Why First and foremost because it was only back in May when President Obama took time out of his extremely busy schedule to deliver an address at the FEMA National Response Coordination Center in Washington where he made a point to stress that Americans who are not preparing for disaster or who do not have emergency evacuation plans for any given scenario could find themselves in big trouble in the near future The following excerpt from Obamas speech comes directly from the official White House website  One of the things that we have learned over the course of the last seven and a half years is that government plays a vital role but it is every citizens responsibility to be prepared for a disaster And that means taking proactive steps like having an evacuation plan having a fully stocked disaster supply kit If your local authorities ask you to evacuate you have to do it Dont wait Thats the biggest reason why Second all one has to do is look around at our surroundings to see that right now the perfect storm of pure chaos is brewing all around us As our allies in Berlin who have nuclear missiles pointed in their direction by the Russians can attest to Geopolitical tensions are sky right now German leaders along with leaders in the Czeck Republic have issued warnings to their people to begin stockpiling food and emergency supplies in case of what could be an existence threatening event Not helping matters geopolitically is the fact that the entire financial banking system of the West which includes the US Dollar as the World Reserve Currency was built as a debtbased monetary system and now that the debt saturation process has run its full course the global economy is on the verge of what is being called a global reset which could occur at any moment Lastly here domestically the 2016 presidential election has gotten so divisive that supporters from both political parties have vowed not to accept the winner if its not their candidate and some groups have even promised the largest civil uprising in our nations history if the election doesnt go their way If that was all that was in the news it would be enough to put anyone on edge What I talk about in the video below is a recent article from earlier this week from The Daily Caller  In that article among other things it reports that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Joseph Dunford has had to issue a reminderwarning to the troops to stay committed to their oaths as well as the chain of command in the coming weeks In light of everything Ive been warning people of this recent report is most troubling The Daily Caller Reports Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Joseph Dunford wrote a Medium blog post Monday to remain committed to its military oath amid the 2016 election What we must collectively guard against is allowing our institution to become politicized or even perceived as being politicized by how we conduct ourselves during engagements with the media the public or in open or social forums Dunford reminded troops Dunford further urged service members that the military must remain committed to the chain of command structure until the next administration comes in and that the military should not undermine its credibility in the interim with the next president I have a duty to protect the integrity and political neutrality of our military profession he continued Dunfords comments also come amid increased concern that the US military is becoming too politicized He is reportedly furious with Retired Marine Gen John Allen and Retired Army Gen Michael Flynn for actively campaigning on behalf of the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Martin Dempsey openly rebuked Allen and Flynn for injecting themselves into the political process The American people should not wonder where their military leaders draw the line between military advice and political preference he lamented in a letter to The Washington Post He continued our nations soldiers sailors airmen and Marines should not wonder about the political leanings and motivations of their leaders The letter is also likely addressing recent political statements by active duty service members on social media A female sailor posted a video of herself sitting through morning colors in protest of supposed racism in the national anthem in August The protest video was inspired by 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick THE VOICE OF REASON is the pen name of Michael DePinto a graduate of
