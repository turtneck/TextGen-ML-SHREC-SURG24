Subscribe My daughter and me Yesterday was National Daughters Day I know this because Facebook told me so well maybe not Mark Zuckerberg himself but all my friends on Facebook were posting pictures of their daughters and celebrating National Daughters Day so it must be true right Actually I Googled it and guess what September 24 is NOT National Daughters DayAccording to Wikipedia  National Daughters Day is August 11th This little snippet in Wikipedia also stated that National Daughters Day originated from the Bible I have done some more digging and honestly I cant find proof for either the day or the fact that the Bible calls for it So it got me to thinking How did a day which didnt actually exist go viral in just a few hours on Facebook There has to be a need which something like this fills or else the entire Facebook population wouldnt have jumped on it so quickly Then it hit me We love our daughters It really is that simple We love our daughters so much that we felt we needed to tell them so publicly on Facebook I saw some of the cutest baby pictures and some of the sweetest words of love scroll through my Facebook feed yesterday Mothers and fathers discussing how sweet their little girls were and exclaiming pride in the women they had become All ages were represented It was really quite moving and it was a wonderful change from the politics and hatred I normally see there My question is why did we need to create a fictitious holiday to say these things We all know our society is in desperate need of love but yesterday also proved that our society is desperate to show love It is OK to tell the world you love your daughter or for that matter your son your wife your husband your life partner your best friend your ex your mailman your mother your dog or your local friendly hardware store worker You dont need a special occasion or an official day We dont have to all agree it is OK to do it on that particular day Just love Show it openly Tell the world and Facebook Do it every day Its in your DNA You need it I declare today National I Am Going To Post About Who I Love Dayevery day By the way My daughter Mallory is intelligent beautiful and compassionate and I am blessed that she calls me Mom Just thought I would throw that in since it is National I Am Going To Post About Who I Love Day Now faith hope and love remainthese three thingsand the greatest of these is love 1 Corinthians 13 About Melanie Tubbs Melanie Tubbs is a professor pastor mother Mimi and true Arkansas woman She lives with six cats and two dogs on a quiet hill in a rural county where she pastors a church and teaches history at the local university Her slightly addictive personality comes out in shameful Netflix binges and a massive collection of books Vegetarian cooking reading mountains of books for her seminary classes and crocheting for the churches prayer shawl ministry take up most of her free time and sharing the love of Christ forms the direction of her life May the Peace of Christ be with You Connect
