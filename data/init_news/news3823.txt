CNN Donald Trumps reversal on the birther controversy is turning attention  at least for the moment  from a major shift in the presidential raceThe battle for the White House  dominated by Hillary Clinton only weeks ago  is tightening dramatically a nervewracking turn for Democrats that sets up what could be a nailbiter election in 52 daysA cascade of new polls this week suggest close contests in key states such as Virginia  the home of Clintons running mate  and Michigan where Democrats have won every cycle since 1992Nationally in CNNs poll of polls  Clinton stands at 43 to Trumps 41 In the mustwin states of Florida and Ohio Trump and Clinton are deadlocked in this weeks CNNORC poll as well as several other surveysIn Iowa  a state President Barack Obama won twice  Trump leapt to an 8point lead among likely voters over Clinton in a Monmouth University poll released Thursday his largest lead yet in a battleground state And in Virginia Clinton and Trump were virtually tied at 40 to 37Of course the 2016 campaign has plenty of twists ahead that could once again reshape the race in an instant The latest came Friday when Trump ended five years of pushing conspiracy theories about Obamas birthplace and finally acknowledged he was born in the United States And the first presidential debate which will likely be a pivotal moment for both campaigns is nine days awayBut the recent polls underscore concerns about the effectiveness of Clintons strategy which has centered on convincing voters Trump is unfit to be commander in chief as well as her ability to lift vulnerable House and Senate Democrats in November with the same effectiveness as Obama in 2008 and 2012 The Democratic nominee is coming off one of the toughest weeks of her campaign forced to the sidelines for three days to recover from pneumoniaWhat matters is who registers to vote and who is motivated and mobilized to turn out to vote she told reporters And Im going to keep doing everything I can to deliver my message about whats at stake in this electionOne of the most striking takeaways from the poll findings this week is that even with all of Trumps controversies and polarizing comments Clinton is still struggling to stitch together key parts of the Obama coalition That point was particularly evident in the new NBCWall Street JournalMarist state polls this week that showed her with softer support from Latinos and young voters than ObamaThis election really in some ways is coming down to young voters said Della Volpe She has not yet solidified what arguably should be one of the core constituencies of any Democratic campaignWhen I hear folks saying theyre not inspired in this election I disagree Obama said I am inspired because for eight years I have had the privilege to see what it takes to do this job and heres what I know for sure  Right now we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become presidentClinton and her allies brushed off the weeks new numbers as an expected development in what the Democratic candidate said was always going to be a tight raceJoel Benenson Clintons chief strategist told CNNs Erin Burnett in an interview Thursday that the campaign was still playing for 270 electoral votesWe are still playing more offense in states around the country and keeping the Trump campaign on defense particularly in states that are mustwins for them like Virginia and North Carolina Benenson said Theyre not making us play defense anywhereWhats happened as much as anything else is that the election is taking on the contours of the 2012 election to a very large extent said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin The ups and downs in the race have depended on the degree to which Mitt Romney voters from 2012 considered Trump to be acceptable or beyond the fringe  Right now what we are seeing in the polls is that more Romney voters are willing to go with TrumpGarin an adviser to the proClinton super PAC Priorities USA Action suggested that in the long run there could be an advantage to Trumps calmer demeanor for his Democratic opponentWhen Donald Trump is not behaving hes sort of like a car crash that people cant help but stop and look at Garin said If Trump is being less outrageous and less titillating it means that Hillary Clinton has a better chance to get her own message through and have the election litigated on her own termsIn a reflective speech Thursday Clinton said her few days off the trail helped clarify what the 2016 campaign is about Contrasting her style and tone with her rivals she once again called Trump a loose cannon who would put Americas gains at risk Charting her course for the next few weeks she said she would focus on working families and the challenges facing young people In a nod to her vulnerabilities she also acknowledged some of the criticisms of her public personaI have been involved in politics one way or another for many years It is not an easy business It can get rough and I have built up some defenses she said When it comes to public service I am better at the service part than the public partBut she said she was not the showman that her opponent is and promised to deliver for you and your family which will be one of the cornerstones of her message in the final stretch of the campaignThe closeness of the polls clearly could mean more difficult races for downballot Democratic Senate and House candidates who are hoping Clintons candidacy and her wellorganized operation will give them a lift at the pollsIn New Hampshire this week for example Republican Sen Kelly Ayotte opened an 8point lead over Democratic Gov Maggie Hassan 52 to 44 among likely voters in a new NBCWSJMarist poll after earlier polls had showed a much closer raceAs voters are paying more attention to the race University of New Hampshire Survey Center Director Andy Smith said Clintons vulnerabilities are coming into sharper focus and that is having a drag on the ticket So much attention has been focused on Trump throughout the campaign he said that people paid less attention to how unpopular Clinton wasThe candidate who has coattails is the candidate who is going to be able to pull in voters who might not otherwise have voted  and thats what Obama was able to do in 2008 and 2012 especially among younger voters AfricanAmerican voters and minority voters Smith saidBut this year many of those young voters in New Hampshire voted for Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders in the primary Smith notedObama was able to pull them out in 2008 and to a lesser extent in 2012 and they voted for Democrats down the ticket but theyre much less likely to vote this time around with Clinton at the top of the ticket he saidSome Democrats expect the Obama coalition to coalesce as Election Day draws closerThere is clearly a gap for Clinton with younger voters that her campaign will pay attention to said Bill Burton a former adviser to Obama But once younger voters realize that anything but a vote for Clinton is a vote for Trump the numbers will settle and the artificially high Gary Johnson numbers will come back to earth  The Obama coalition is lagging in getting behind Clinton but the debates will help natural gravity set in and bring this race where it will endOther Democrats see a bright side to a closer race at the top of the ticket in the sense that it could propel more voters to get out to the polls House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that if Republicans want to believe that this race is tightening let them believe thatBecause the more our own people see that its important to vote and a tight race sort of speaks to that urgency then more of them will turn out So it works to our advantage Pelosi said
