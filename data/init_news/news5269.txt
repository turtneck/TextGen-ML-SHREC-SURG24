Washington CNN Buying votes is illegal But it turns out buying delegates might not beThis summers Republican National Convention is shaping up to be an allout brawl for every delegates vote  and legally that could mean plying some of them with gifts experts sayThere are federal and state laws prohibiting bribery of elected officials  and restrictions on campaigns themselves  but there isnt much on the books governing what private citizens serving as delegates at their parties conventions can take in exchange for their votes on a nominating ballot And in a fight between Donald Trump Ted Cruz John Kasich and perhaps an alternative not currently in the race every delegate vote will matterI think the legal term is s show said Ken Gross an election law specialist at Skadden and former associate general counsel of the Federal Election Commission I think its going to be a circus to say the leastThe GOP candidates are battling to win the 1237 delegates needed to win the partys nomination and avert a floor fight in July at the convention in Cleveland Trump holds a lead of 739 delegates to 466 for Cruz and 145 for Kasich according to a CNN estimateOpponents of Trump are especially worried about the potential resources of the billionaire businessmanTrumps senior adviser Barry Bennett has indicated the campaign is exploring how to bring delegates to its side but made clear there is a limitTheres obviously a big line  were not going to do anything immoral illegal or unethical Bennett told CNN Most of the time all they want is some access to the candidate or a visit to their state Its just a prioritization on your schedule nothing more heavy than thatWere not offering seats on the Trump airplane or anything like that he offered saying that the type of person who would seek such a deal wouldnt be a delegate the campaign would wantHe also doubted other campaigns would engage in such tacticsOf course campaigns and candidates are not the only entities that have funds they are looking to spend on a political process  and the rules and scrutiny on those outside groups and individuals are much murkierThere are a variety of laws and regulations that could come into play for delegates going to this years convention Elected officials are bound by socalled honest services statutes and party officials also are restricted by their roleBut many of the thousands of individuals who will be trekking to Cleveland as one of the 2472 delegates with a vote on nominee will be private citizens eager to engage in what is shaping up to be a historic contestAside from the limits of who can give the FEC is mostly silent on what delegates may or may not accept And it doesnt speak to any sort of negotiation for positions in an administration or say the promise of reciprocal campaign supportThe Republican National Committee rules are also quiet on what can be done to curry favor with delegates but the party pointed to the need to comply with FEC rulesThe RNC rules do not specifically address this however there are FEC implications once you start expending money related to attempts to influence a federal election RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said It is up to the individual delegates and campaigns to ensure that they are in compliance with any applicable federal regulationsPart of the murkiness is simply the novelty of the race There hasnt been a contested convention in decades since Ronald Reagan challenged the incumbent President Gerald Ford in 1976 and most people involved in the process havent witnessed one in their professional livesThough Trump is far ahead in the delegate count there is serious doubt he will be able to reach the majority mark needed to clinch the nomination outright And that could mean that after two ballots at the convention as many as 8 in 10 delegates could become unbound from their state votes  freeing them to vote for whomever they wishThe catch legal experts say is that a ballot at a party convention is not the same thing as a vote in a local or federal election And horsetrading is de rigueur in politicsIf youre going to hand somebody a greasestained sandwich bag filled with cash under a table you better hope nobodys got a cell phone nearby whos videotaping it said Richard E BergAndersson a researcher and historian for The Green Papers blog which covers the nominating process in depth As for positions thats historical There were always delegates who wanted better support if they were running for a congressional seat especially if they were already party operatives or politicians Thats actually part of the political process In fact I dont even really think its unethicalThis is kind of uncharted but I think a lot of the discussions and deals that are cut are more political in nature rather than monetary said Michael Toner a partner at Wiley Rein and former FEC chairmanAny candidate individual or super PAC looking to curry favor with delegates would have to pay attention to all 50 states laws and every state partys rulesBut several state party chairmen interviewed by CNN were not aware of any explicit prohibitions on accepting gifts or travel helpThere arent many rules or laws on this issue acknowledged South Carolina GOP Chairman Matt Moore I have said the process should be above board and honest and transparent I highly discourage our delegates to take anything in exchange for their votes  its a slippery moral and legal slopeBut hes limited to those powers of verbal persuasion he saidThats all you can do beyond electing an honest and fair set of delegates he saidThe question then will come down to those 2472 men and women a few of whom when contacted by CNN immediately ruled out accepting any material supportTom Lundstrum a former Arkansas state GOP rules chairman who served on the 2012 RNC rules committee is running to be one of Cruzs delegates He said he hoped campaigns and independent entities couldnt do much to influence delegatesI would hope that theres very little they can do he said They couldnt do anything for me I have heard that it is OK for campaigns to pay the travel expenses of their delegates to the convention But beyond that I dont know
