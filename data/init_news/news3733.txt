After the Paris attacks Americans are divided on Obamas plan to let in 10000 Syrian refugees The timing is good Thanksgiving can shed light on how much the nations tradition of hospitality should influence this decisionSyria refugee Nedal AlHayk works as a fabricator in Warren Mich Several US governors are threatening to halt efforts to allow Syrian refugees into their states in the aftermath of the coordinated attacks in Paris though an immigration expert says they have no legal authority to do soJust as Americans prepare to express their hospitality toward others during Thanksgiving a national debate has erupted over another kind of hospitality President Obamas plan to welcome 10000 Syrian refugees into the United States After the Paris attacks the plan has been widely challenged not least by nearly half the US governors They fear Islamic State terrorists might slip in as sleepers among the refugees Others argue back that the US already rigorously vets all asylum seekers  for as long as two yearsMight Thanksgiving with all its traditions and meaning shed some light on this debateThe practice of welcoming strangers into ones home or community long precedes the first American thanksgiving that autumn feast of 1621 when Pilgrims and native Americans expressed gratitude for either the harvest each other or Gods mercy or all of the above Hospitality is an ancient Middle East virtue rooted in the traditions of desert tribes and deeply encoded in the three Abrahamic religions In the scriptural book of Hebrews we read Be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawaresHospitality like Thanksgiving is a type of giving that treats others  rich or poor stranger or family  as equals In ancient days this egalitarian focus was symbolized by the washing of a guests feet Today it serves as a cornerstone for democracy It is also the basis for the United Nations Refugee Convention in which a majority of the worlds states have agreed to grant asylum to people deemed to be refugeesIn the US a thanksgiving day was not an official holiday until Lincoln made it one during the Civil War The woman who championed it Sarah Hale wrote in 1864 Let us each see to it that on this one day there shall be no family or individual within the compass of our means to help who shall not have some portion prepared and some reason to join in the general ThanksgivingGranting permanent asylum in the US to a refugee of course is not the same as sharing a turkey dinner with a stranger Todays modern nationstates are careful about who crosses their borders either to prevent problems or to enhance their society But with 1 in every 122 people now either a refugee internally displaced or seeking asylum the need for hospitality is great And in hospitality a nation can find its greatness
