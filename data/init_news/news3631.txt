Happy Memorial Day But if youre in Wisconsin and relying on food stamps remember thatRepublicans dont want you to have ketchup on your hamburger Theyd probably rather you didnt have a hamburger at all but Wisconsin farmers and ranchers have clout and so proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program made room for Wisconsin products But they still dont want you to have crab lobster shrimp or any other shellfish Or ketchup Or spaghetti sauce ReallyFor now thats all grandstanding SNAP is a federal program and the Obama administration hasnt allowed states to restrict food purchases that way But that hasnt stopped GOP legislators from trying Maine and Missouri want to ban SNAP junk food purchases Wisconsin and 16 other states are also trying to drug test recipientsAnd Wisconsin has nothing on Brownbackistan I mean Kansas The state has already outlawed the use of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program debit cards at a range of businesses including movie theaters college sports games  and cruise ships There goes the welfare cruise ship business Kansas TANF recipients also are unable to withdraw more than 25 a day from their accounts That means to withdraw 100 theyll pay five bank fees since ATMs only dispense 20s Banks win the poor loseAll this is happening against the backdrop of GOP policy failure Weve had a 30plus year experiment in Republican approaches to the problems of poverty and declining economic opportunity  and its turned out abysmally Ronald Reagan convinced a lot of people that we fought a war on poverty and poverty won so Democrats came together with Republicans and slashed the largest welfare program for families with children first in the states then federally Bill Clinton signed the federal bill into law thinking he could get the issue of the lazy poor behind him and then concentrate on the supports lowwage workers might need to climbOf course Clinton never completed that part of his agenda he got distracted by the GOP witch hunt known as impeachment Republicans still didnt want to make friends even after Clinton gave them punitive welfare reform go figureThen George W Bush became president and we got a lesson in the way tax cuts create jobs  as in they dont In eight years of the Clinton administration which raised top tax rates 23 million jobs were created compared with 3 million in the eight lowtax Bush years It might be time to try a whole new approach to fighting poverty  raising the minimum wage strengthening workers ability to bargain investing in infrastructure to shore up our roads bridges and rail system but also to create jobs expanding access to college Instead red state GOP legislators are pushing ever crueler ways to treat the poor like garbage Sam Brownbacks Kansas is becoming an ever more awful dystopia Its an absolute laboratory for taxcutting welfareslashing schemes and its circling the drain economically Scott Walker is an amateur compared to Brownback but hes working hard to make sure Wisconsin ties Kansas for the most dysfunctional economy The Wisconsin GOPs bogus health claims for the SNAP cuts are belied the Huffington Post observes by the fact that the amended law now allows the purchase of any and all dairy products thanks to the power of the states dairy lobby Theoretically a SNAP recipient could spent the whole months allotment on Dippin Dots one legislator notes The ice cream of the future is now on the list of whats acceptable to pay for but a bottle of ketchup is not he noted But of course this isnt about the keeping the poor healthy its about punishing them The fact that the cuts almost certainly wont be enacted makes them more cynical in a way This is how you tell the Kochs and scared white people that the slackers and moochers are being punished It accomplishes nothing but its good politically Thats still the core premise of Republican politics and it will remain so through the 2016 election at least
