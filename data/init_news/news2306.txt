A longterm highway bill passed by the House Thursday took years to work its way to the surface of a Congress that was never designed for the quick fixHouse Speaker Paul Ryan R of Wisconsin smiles during his news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington on Thursday The House has voted to continue transportation programs for six years with no significant increase in spendingIn the new House of Ryan where lawmakers have been promised a greater say in legislating members burned themidnightoil this week as they worked through scores of amendments to overwhelmingly pass a sixyear bipartisan highway billon ThursdayIt was the first longterm bill in a decade to repair Americas crumbling roads bridges and transit systems and members jumped at the new opportunity to give their inputTheres a lot of pentup legislative energy around here and when a real piece of legislation comes along that impacts every district in America dramatically  then a lot of people have a lot of ideas says Rep Peter DeFazio D of Oregon the top Democrat on the House Transportation Committee and lead cosponsor of the billThe past few days have taught a lesson patience Butask Congressman DeFazio and hell say the patience needed to bring this bill to reality has been measured in years not hours or days Hes been working toward this day since he was named a subcommittee chairman in 2007 His own president resisted his efforts Then the House changed handsEven now he acknowledges the bill isnt what he wanted since it keepsspending flat and is funded for only three years But after such a long slog hes pleasedIve never really stopped working on itIn life patience is a virtue and on Capitol Hill doubly so Congress was never designed for the quick fix The Founding Fathers deliberately created two very different chambers so that there would be an opportunity for second thoughts as former Senate historian Don Ritchie puts itTurning ideas into a workable form and winning backing for a bill as big as this requires educating members hearing them out negotiating and working with outside interests It can take years to get to yesYet thats easily forgotten or dismissed by some newcomers This is especially true in the age of Twitter when voters know instantly what their senator or representative did  or didnt do  and then make their demands for instant results immediately knownConsider freshman Sen Marco Rubio R of Florida a man in a hurry to become president He got fed up with the slow pace of the Senate where in his first year in 2011 he asked in a floor speech Do we just stand around and do nothingFor lawmakers who were once top dogs at home  Senator Rubio was speaker of the House in Florida  its frustrating to arrive as a pup in a slowmoving Congress that values seniorityIn his early years Rubio was left to author symbolic resolutions such as one that congratulated the Miami Heat for their NBA championship He got his big break when he joined the Gang of Eight senators who pushed bipartisan immigration reform through the Senate in 2013 Then he watched it die slowly from neglect in the HouseIf hes elected president we can begin to fix some of these issues that Ive been so frustrated weve been unable to address during my time in the Senate Rubio toldNBCs Matt Lauer recently Has the Floridian talked to President Obama  himself a sprinting former senator  about the frustrations of working with Congress even when your party controls both housesJohn Boehner underscored the need for patience when he gave up the speakers gavel to Paul Ryan R of Wisconsin last week Real change takes time the outgoing speaker said to a packed chamber as he reflected on his accomplishments Freedom makes all things possible But patience is what makes all things realA subtle dig at the hardline rebellious Freedom Caucus who drove him out of the speakershipWhen you get people who are impatient and ideologically driven they feel like fish out of water in Congress says former House historian Raymond Smock The truth of the matter is they are because ideology is the opposite of pragmatismA functioning Congress requires its members to want to govern Mr Smock says Many people have many ideas on how to fix things but the country is a big wide place and the world is complicated Things are not so simple and ideology tends to make things simpleHe quotes former Democratic Speaker Tip ONeill If you want efficient government get yourself a dictatorshipFrustration with the slowly turning gears of Congress is not new Howard Shuman an aide to former Sen Paul Douglas D of Illinois during the civil rights fights of the 1950s and 60s told historian Ritchie in an oral historyabout his sevenyear principleThats how long he found it took to getfrom the inception of a significant legislative idea to its passageMost of the major legislation I worked on that was new forward looking which started out heavily opposed and without a mandate after seven years of convincing of publicity of talking of arguing of hearings finally made it It took that much time and that much effort and that much struggle to come off Struggle is the wordIn truth the battle over the highway bill isnt even finished yetIt could get full sixyear funding when House and Senate negotiators come together to hammer out the final versionAt points Congress has tried to make itself more efficient After World War II for instance it tried joint committees so witnesses wouldnt have to testify twice It didnt work mainly because the House and Senate are such different bodies  one controlled by the majority the other designed to operate more by consensusCrises such as wars and economic catastrophes can speed up action And when things get really stuck lawmakers try changing the rules  such as Speaker Ryan says he wants to do Ironically by opening up the process so that his members  particularly the Freedom Caucus  have more say and fewer gripes it will take longer to get things done On the other hand it may also give him the buyin he needs to move bills forwardEveryone wants to feel part of the process and have their proposal considered says Rep John Mica R of Florida the former chairman of the Transportation Committee in an interview Speaker Boehner too opened up the process when he took over but power eventually massed back at the top  partly for greater efficiencyThis goes in cycles says Congressman Mica Now that theres been a rebellion well go back to this open process and see how it worksDeFazio on the other side of the aisle thinks it could work wellThis is the way it used to be We got more things done back then even though it was more time consuming
