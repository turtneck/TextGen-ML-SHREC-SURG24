Ohio governor John Kasich who is still running for president effectively reminded the public of his continued presence in the Republican presidential race on Friday by making a rather regressive comment about how women could avoid being sexually assaultedDont go to parties where theres a lot of alcohol Kasich suggested during an appearance at St Lawrence University in Canton New York when a female student asked how he would tackle sexual violence at colleges and universities Kasich a millennial in an older mans body provided several policy answersincrease access to rape kits and confidential reporting for instanceand then provided that one bit of adviceRecognizing within minutes that he might have stepped in it the Kasich Twitter feed went hastily into damage control modeThis isnt the first time that Kasich has made awkward comments about women this week On Tuesday he was baffled during a town hall when a young woman asked him about social security responding Did someone tell you to ask that question Her response No I think for myselfNot surprisingly Kasich has a history of making regularly cringeworthy comments about women His greatest hits include telling a female questioner at a town hall I dont have any tickets for Taylor Swift and bragging about how women left their kitchens to vote for him in Ohio In February he signed a bill defunding Planned Parenthood and in 2013 he signed a gag rule into law that cut funding for rape crisis centers that provided information about abortion servicesWomen may not all love John Kasich but John Kasich loves them Are you available he asked one woman who stood up to ask a question at a campaign event earlier this month You look great tonight Right on schedule governor
