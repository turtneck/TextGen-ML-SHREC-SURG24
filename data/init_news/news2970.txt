Less than 24 hours after President Barack Obama aimed to set the tone for the country on a response to the threat of terrorism with an Oval Office address Trump only needed a press release to cause an uproar with his call for an outright ban on Muslims entering the United StatesThe billionaire businessman stood defiantly by his statement on Tuesday morning when he warned that failing to follow his plans would lead to another September 11style terror attack on US soilYoure going to have many more World Trade Centers if you dont solve it  many many more and probably beyond the World Trade Center Trump told CNNs Chris Cuomo in a contentious interview on New DayThe episode is a microcosm of how the 2016 campaign has played out Trump has consistently forced candidates state party chairs senators and conservative pundits to respond to his actions and quotes however outlandish and improbable And in turn they have all struggled with the question of how to deal with the bombastic real estate tycoon who has dominated state and national polls since the summerTrumps enduring ability to frame the terms of the debate for the GOP continues to have party leaders fretting he will drive voters to Hillary Clinton help downballot Democrats and cause longterm damage to the Republican brandYet unlike with past provocative statements Trump appears to have sparked a level of backlash from GOP party leaders and his opponents that could be a tipping point for the willingness of fellow Republicans to criticize him directly and openly Jeb Bush called Trump unhinged Ted Cruz said it wasnt his policy And Dick Cheney who previously said he would back the Republican nominee even it was Trump said that Mondays proposal goes against everything we stand for and believe inAt a press conference on Tuesday House Speaker Paul Ryan also slammed TrumpThis is not conservatism he said What was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands forBut Trump has been here before  his blustery statements

familyDoug Heye a veteran GOP strategist and former adviser to the Iowa Republican Party said Trumps latest proposal would do more damage than some of his previous controversial commentsThere are

Trumps proposal Some were happy to blast the GOP frontrunner others like Iowas Joni Ernst wanted nothing to do with the questionErnst who occupies an influential spot among Iowa Republicans walked away from repeated questions about whether she supported Trumps callOh Im not going to comment on that she said when asked by CNN about his comments Asked again she replied I am not commenting on himSouth Carolina Sen Tim Scott a firstterm senator who has been hosting Republican candidates at forums and will be on the ballot in 2016 suggested that Trumps latest statements were simply par for the courseA lot of hyperbolic language is used during campaign season Scott said in a statement to CNN We need to focus on serious solutions to address the real dangers presented by ISISSen Jeff Sessions an Alabama Republican who has advised Trump on immigration policy and appeared onstage with him at a rally in Alabama didnt want to weigh inIve been pleased that he took a lot of my ideas in his immigration policy but I have not endorsed Mr Trump or anyone else Sessions said when asked about Trumps comments Pressed on whether he would support Trumps proposal Sessions became quiet and stopped talking as he rushed to a Senate elevatorSen Jim Inhofe an Oklahoma Republican said that Trump was wrong to call for a ban on all Muslim travel to the US If he had changed instead of saying Muslim and said radical Islam then I would agree with him But I dont agree Inhofe said noting that theres a big difference between banning travel for anyone identified as a radical Islamic terrorist and all MuslimsSen John McCain the partys 2008 nominee and a supporter of Sen Lindsey Grahams longshot bid was clear Its just foolishness Its been a long series of statements like this that have been just foolishMcCain and Graham have been among the most critical of Trump but all to no avail Graham for instance trails Trump in his home state of South Carolina And when Trump seemed to suggest that McCain a Vietnamera POW and the GOPs 2008 nominee was not a war hero it didnt hurt his standing in the pollsOpponents and party leaders seem to be in search of a referee who can credibly rebuke Trump

identity Republicans sought to strip the conservative label from Trump  New Hampshire GOP leader Jennifer Horn called his ideas unRepublicanCheney weighed in as wellI think this whole notion that somehow we can just say no more Muslims just ban a whole religion goes against everything we stand for and believe in he said on Hugh Hewitts radio show I mean religious freedom has been a very important part of our history and where we came fromBill Kristol who tweeted that he has come to loathe Trump for soiling the robe of conservatism and dragging it through the dust said in an email to
