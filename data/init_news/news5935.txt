Another Trump Surrogate Admits Trump Wont Build That Effing Wall VIDEO By Darrell Lucus on October 26 2016 Subscribe Trump foreign policy surrogate and adviser Walid Phares with several EthiophianAmerican Trump supporters  image courtesy Phares Facebook Just after the Republican National Convention I told you that a number of Donald Trumps top surrogates have known for some time that the Donalds signature policy proposala massive wall along the Mexican border only exists in Trumps mind  They have all but admitted what we already knowa 2000mile physical wall is simply not feasible Well we got more confirmation earlier this week from another prominent Trump surrogate Specifically his chief foreign policy adviser admitted what we have long suspectedwhen Trump declares Im building a wall hes just engaging in campaign hype People for the American Ways Right Wing Watch noticed that on Monday veteran foreign policy and terrorism expert Walid Phares sat down with France 24s Surabhi Tandon to discuss Trumps approach to foreign policy Phares served as a top foreign policy adviser to the Mitt Romney campaign and took up the same role with Trump He is best known as an ardent Islamophobe who had close ties to extremist militia groups during the civil war in his native Lebanon The conversation soon turned to Trumps wall Right Wing Watch got a clip Tandon asked Phares how Trumps planned wall would affect the United States relationship with Mexico Trump has let it be known that one way or another Mexico will foot the bill for the wall Phares replied that Trump plans to build the wall along the American side of the border However as far as he knows it wont be a brickandmortar wall Now will we see a physical wall on hundreds and hundreds of miles of border I dont know and I dont think so According to Phares what Trump has in mind is something like what exists in Ceuta and Melilla two Spanish enclaves in north Africa He claimed that there was a simple concept in place in those cities for anyone who wanted to cross into Spain via Moroccoyou come you knock on the door you have your paper and you come in Tandon pounced reminding Phares that Trump has been clamoring for a physical wall for the entire campaign But this major Trump surrogate apparently didnt get the memo Phares claimed that Trump only talked about building a wall to raise the attention However since then Phares has said that Trump has evolved the concept of a wall How so Meaning If nothing is done Im going to go back to square one and build a wall But if I can start talking with the Mexicans I may not have to do all the wall everywhere because the Mexican government is going to finally send troops to stop these cartels But wait a minute Trump himself has declared the wall will stretch along the entire border And he even managed to get the wall into the Republican platform See for yourself  on page 26 We support building a wall along our southern border and protecting all ports of entry The border wall must cover the entirety of the southern border and must be sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic And yet a major Trump surrogateindeed his top surrogate on foreign policyhas effectively left his candidate on an island Watch the whole thing here  the exchange about the wall begins at the 630 mark As I write this on Wednesday night I can find no evidence that either Trump or the RNC has spoken up to correct the record And I can find no evidence that Phares himself has tried to clarify his remarks I can only conclude one thingTrump himself knows hes not building a wall About Darrell Lucus Darrell is a 30something graduate of the University of North Carolina who considers himself a journalist of the old school An attempt to turn him into a member of the religious right in college only succeeded in turning him into the religious rights worst nightmarea charismatic Christian who is an unapologetic liberal His desire to stand up for those who have been scared into silence only increased when he survived an abusive threeyear marriage You may know him on Daily Kos as Christian Dem in NC  Follow him on Twitter DarrellLucus or connect with him on Facebook  Click here to buy Darrell a Mello Yello Connect
