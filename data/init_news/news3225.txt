GROWING APPROVAL FOR ECONOMY AND PRESIDENT OBAMA  Emily Swanson Americans views of President Barack Obama have improved slightly in the past two months and opinions are more positive about the direction of the country and the health of the economy an Associated PressGfK poll finds Fortyseven percent of those surveyed approve of how Obama is doing his job compared with 41 percent in December and 51 percent approve of his handling of unemployment compared with 44 percent before Nearly half say the economy is good now while 41 percent thought that in December In December 2013 only onethird called the economy good Approval of the way Obama is handling the economy improved slightly 41 percent to 45 percent over the past two monthsBut people still feel that their own recovery is lagging the poll shows with only 35 percent saying their own family has completely or mostly recovered from economic downturn Just 27 percent see the job market where they live as being most of the way to recovery far less than the number that thinks big businesses 55 percent and the stock market 53 percent have bounced all the way back In spite of growing optimism about politics and the economy 8 in 10 people questioned have little confidence that Obama and Republicans in Congress can work together to solve the countrys problems APHow high is the ceiling on Obamas approval  David Lauter President Obamas standing with the public likely will continue its recent upward trend following the latest positive economic news but new data on the countrys polarized politics suggests hell soon bump up against a low ceiling The labor market data released by the federal government on Friday showed the best three months of job growth since the mid1990s an increase in the percentage of Americans who are working and the first signs of wage growth Thats the kind of good news that usually sends presidential approval ratings upward But political polarization exerts a powerful pull in the other direction Much like President George W Bush before him Obama faces near unanimous disapproval from opposing partisans that is deeply dug in and unlikely to changeIn the past half century the only years that showed more polarization than Obamas sixth year were his  and Bushs  fourth and fifth years All of that suggests that Obamas overall approval rating probably will not rise much above 50 for any sustained period LA TimesFour signs of an improving US jobs situation  Drew DeSilver summarizing Bureau of Labor Statistics 1 More people are getting back into the labor market even if they dont

Walker has had something of a surge over the last week What should we make of it Is there any information to be squeezed out of these pollsthe latest polls tell us almost nothing about voters Most people arent paying attention yet which is why a bit of positive publicity for a candidate can shift polling quite a bit Voters arent reporting firm decisions theyre just responding to whats been in the news lately If these early polls are important it is only because of the way the people who pay close attention to Republican Party politics react to them Thats the real thing to watch going
