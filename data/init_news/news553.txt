Hillary Rodham Clintons tenure as secretary of state was supposed to be a central argument for her forthcoming run for president Her globetrotting record as the nations chief diplomat her role championing womens empowerment and gay rights and her experience on tough national security issues were all supposed to confer credentials that none of her possible GOP opponents would possessBut over the past two weeks with backtoback revelations that she was working with foreign countries that gave millions of dollars to her familys charitable foundation and that she set up and exclusively used a private email system that argument has been put in perilInstead of a fresh chapter in which Clinton came into her own her time as the countrys top diplomat now threatens to remind voters of what some people dislike about her  a tendency toward secrecy and defensiveness along with the whiff of scandal that clouded the presidency of her husband Bill ClintonThat side of Hillary Clinton also plays directly into the main Republican argument against her that she is a candidate of yesterday  as Sen Marco Rubio of Florida recently put it  who comes with decades of baggage the country no longer need carryPart of the reason the story is gaining traction is that it reminds people of what the Clinton White House was like said American University political science professor Jennifer Lawless It reminds people of the scandals the secrecy and the lack of transparency that were often associated with Bill Clintons eight years in WashingtonClinton was already certain to face sharp questions during a presidential campaign about her handling of the deadly attacks on US facilities in Benghazi Libya in 2012 She has never been shown to have any direct role in events leading up to the deaths of the US ambassador and three other Americans but an inquiry that Democrats call a fishing expedition has been given new life by the revelation that her emails were not immediately given to CongressRep Trey Gowdy RSC who chairs a special congressional committee on Benghazi has subpoenaed Clintons emails and plans to call her as a witness once his investigation is further along That will mean a showdown in the middle of a presidential campaign in which she will be trying to reintroduce herself to votersYou do not need a law degree to have an understanding of how troubling this is Gowdy said in a news conference last weekClinton has said nothing about the email controversy beyond a tweet promising to seek to make the messages public On Sunday Sen Dianne Feinstein DCalif said Clinton needs to talk in more detail about the issue From this point on the silence is going to hurt her Feinstein said on NBCs Meet the PressClintons problems at the State Department also make it easier for Republicans to connect her to what they see as President Obamas shaky foreign policy and his broken promise to operate the most transparent administration in historyEven the smallest things are being looked at anew The iconic image of her at the State Department which she chose as her Twitter avatar shows her seated aboard a military transport plane reading something  perhaps email  on her BlackBerryFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush who is weighing a 2016 bid cast her reliance on private email as a serious security risk Its a little baffling to be honest with you that didnt come up in Secretary Clintons thought process the Republican said in a Friday radio interviewAnd while Clinton remains the overwhelming favorite for her partys nomination some Democrats last week were more open about their misgivings about her candidacy On Friday night in New Hampshire former Maryland governor Martin OMalley who might run against her for the first time broke his silence on her use of the private email account saying that openness and transparency are required of governing in the modern ageFor Clinton the State Department years were a kind of protective cocoon from partisan politics even though she was a visible member of a Democratic administration that was doing regular battle with congressional RepublicansShe was rarely called upon to take public positions on partisan issues Her history as a politically active first lady senator and failed Democratic candidate for president were rarely mentioned in daytoday news coverage of her trips and priorities as secretaryClintons busy pace  she visited a record 112 countries  made it easy to deflect questions about the common assumption that she would make another run for the White House when her time at the State Department was overAfter leaving office she wrote a memoir of her time at the State Department that was published last year The book Hard Choices marked her unmistakable entry into the 2016 presidential race and amounted to a virtual campaign manifestoWe have to use all of Americas strengths to build a world with more partners and fewer adversaries more shared responsibility and fewer conflicts more good jobs and less poverty more broadly based prosperity with less damage to our environment Clinton wroteClinton posted a Twitter message Wednesday night  two days into the email controversy  saying she wants the public to see my emails She said she has asked the State Department to review them for releaseThat review could also establish whether she broke any rules about the handling of sensitive informationThe email arrangement meant that Clintons work emails were being routed through a private server in her Chappaqua NY home and were not being archived by the government as now required She handed over 55000 pages of emails upon the State Departments request last year more than a year after she left her postShe has not explained the reason for the unorthodox arrangement and her husband declined to weigh in on Sunday Im not the one to judge that I have an opinion but I have a bias Bill Clinton said in response to a reporters question during a Florida appearance according to Bloomberg Politics He added I shouldnt be making news on thisThe White House has distanced itself from the growing controversy Obama said in an interview with CBS on Saturday that he did not know about Hillary Clintons use of private email until reading news reports last weekThe president does have the expectation that everybody in his administration takes the steps that are necessary to be in compliance with the Federal Records Act and with the Presidential Records Act White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Friday And again that means using as often as possible using your official government email when youre conducting official government businessWhite House officials communicated with Clinton on her private account and it is not clear that any White House official flagged the practice as a potential problemThe email revelation came after the Bill Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation acknowledged in February that it had accepted a foreigngovernment donation in 2010 without submitting it for an ethics review as required in a 2008 agreement with the Obama administrationThe 2008 agreement had been reached to avoid the appearance of conflicts of interest while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state Under the agreement the foundation was to submit any donation from a foreign government that had not previously given money to the foundationThe goal was to allow ethics officers to analyze whether it might appear that the government was trying to influence US policy with a donation to a charity so closely linked to the nations top diplomatThe foundation told The Washington Post that it had failed to follow that process in the case of an unsolicited 500000 donation from the government of Algeria to assist in earthquake relief in Haiti The donation coincided with a spike in lobbying by Algeria which was defending its human rights record to US officialsState Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the donation did not pose a problem because US support for rebuilding efforts in Haiti was well known before the Algerian donation came inProminent Clinton backers have dismissed the recent controversies as minor distractions unimportant to voters and blamed the email flap on a Republican attack machineBut other Democrats expressed exasperation at what they called a slow and hamhanded response to the email controversy by her small group of advisers There is no inhouse campaigngrade rapidresponse operation and outside defenders had little notice that a problem was brewingId be surprised to find a lot of Democrats who think this is going to have a lot of legs said one senior Democratic strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity because Clinton is not yet a candidate But there is a level of angst and annoyance about how badly the thing has been mishandledSeveral Democrats said the controversy is being blown out of proportion and questioned whether Republicans are being subjected to the same level of scrutinyRep Loretta Sanchez DCalif said that Clinton has been aboveboard and that the controversy will quickly fadeShes not trying to hide anything Sanchez said
