Hillary Clinton didnt just take the vast majority of the available delegates in South Carolina on Saturday night She also took away one of Bernie Sanderss strongest arguments  that hes the candidate who has the most workingclass supportIn Iowa and New Hampshire Sanders had done better than Clinton among voters in the lowest income brackets That seemed to bolster his claim that his political revolution could energize millions of new lowincome voters who typically dont turn out to voteThis argument however is much less tenable after tonight Clinton did best among poor voters in South Carolina taking 82 percent of those who earn under 30000 on her way to a 37point victory according to exit polling by the New York TimesHere are the results by income according to the TimesOf course this discrepancy is largely driven by Clintons huge 8713 margin of victory over black voters But thats the point  outside of states like Iowa and New Hampshire many lowincome and workingclass voters arent white Unless Sanders is able to win workingclass voters beyond the whitest electorates in the country his revolution may be over almost as soon as it started
