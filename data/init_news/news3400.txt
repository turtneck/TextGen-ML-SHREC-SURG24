Youve probably seen this chartIt uses analysis from VoteView to show how the House has grown more polarized over time Democrats in the House have become more liberal Republicans have become much more conservativeYou may also have seen this chart  but if you havent you probably at least are familiar with the conceptIt shows the ranges of weekly approval ratings for President Obama over the course of his administration In other words each time 82 percent of Democrats approve of Obama the 82 percent bar gets a little higher For the most part opinions of Obama havent changed much among Democrats or Republicans his overall approval rating is usually a function of how independents feel about himObama isnt the first president to see such polarization in his approval ratings The first president to do so was the guy before him George W Bush Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton each had some polarization in their second terms but it wasnt nearly as wide a gapWhich leads us to a natural question How does the polarization of Congress  which is a measure of the behavior of members of Congress  compare with the polarization of approval of the president a measure of public opinionThats a question we can answerOver time the gap between the political leaning of Republican and Democratic caucuses on Capitol Hill has widened steadily though not continuously This compares DWNOMINATE scores from VoteView which is a measure of how liberal or conservative each member of Congress is against a baseline The figures below essentially measure the distance between the two lines in the first graph aboveOver that same period opinions of the president have similarly widened  again with some fits and startsThere are two lines here one using the first Gallup approval rating of the new year and the other averaging the ratings over the year You can see how attitudes shift the gap plummets as a president becomes equally popular or unpopular with each partyAnyway this suggests that as Congress has gotten more polarized so too have opinions of the presidentsBut theres a clearer way to look at this Plotting the gap in how Democrats and Republicans look at the president on one axis and the gap between the two parties in Congress on the other you can see clearly how both the former and latter have grown more extreme The higher and further to the right a dot the greater the polarizationIn other words this polarization isnt only a function of Congress and gerrymandering Theres been a broader polarization thats taken place reflected in how each party views the presidentWhat it doesnt tell us is the cause As complicated as these data are this was the easier part of the analysis
