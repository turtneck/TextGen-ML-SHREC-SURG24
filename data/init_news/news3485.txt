The Civil War eras 14th Amendment granting automatic citizenship to any baby born on American soil is a proud achievement of the Party of LincolnBut now House Republicans are talking about abolishing birthright citizenshipA House Judiciary subcommittee took up the question Wednesday afternoon prompted by legislation sponsored by Rep Steve King RIowa and 22 other lawmakers that after nearly 150 years would end automatic citizenshipThe 14th Amendment King told the panel did not contemplate that anyone who would sneak into the United States and have a baby would have automatic citizenship conferred on them Added King Id suggest its our job here in this Congress to decide who will be citizens not someone in a foreign country that can sneak into the United States and have a baby and then go home with the birth certificateIts no small task to undo a principle enshrined in the Constitution and upheld by the Supreme Court that defines the United States as a nation of immigrants Its particularly audacious that House Republicans would undo a century and a half of precedent without amending the Constitution but merely by passing a law to reinterpret the 14th Amendments wording in a way that will stop the scourge of anchor babies and birth tourismJudiciary Committee Republicans brought in three experts to testify in support of this extraordinary maneuver a lone Democratic witness was opposed and they evidently had to search far and wide for people who would take this view because they ended up with a bizarre witness an octogenarian professor from the University of Texas named Lino GragliaThis would be the Lino Graglia who caused a furor in 1997 when he said that Latinos and African Americans are not academically competitive with whites and come from a culture that seems not to encourage achievement He also said at the time that I dont know that its good for whites to be with the lower classesThis is also the same Lino Graglia who said in a 2012 interview that black and Hispanic children are less academically competent than white children and he attributed the academic gap to the deleterious experience of being reared by single mothers When the interviewer a black man said he had a single mother Graglia said that my guess would be that youre above usual smartness for whites to say nothing of blacksAnd this is the very same Lino Graglia whose nomination for a federal judgeship in the 1980s fell apart amid allegations that he had urged Austin residents to defy a courtordered busing plan and had used the racist word pickaninny in the classroomAbolishing automatic citizenship for babies born on American soil and having Graglia make the case probably wont help Republicans overcome their problems with minorities who are gradually becoming the majority Democrats by happenstance presented a sharp contrast to the GOP effort Wednesday Sens Elizabeth Warren Mass and Sherrod Brown Ohio and others met at Washingtons Carnegie Library with a coalition including immigration and civil rights advocates to launch a new jobs campaign Putting Families FirstAt the birthright hearing King got things going by informing his colleagues that birth tourism has grown substantially and that it costs 48000 for a Chinese national to fly to the United States have her baby get a birth certificate and take the child back to China Though conservatives generally take a dim view of international law King said the United States in this case should follow almost every other industrialized country in abolishing birthright citizenshipGraglia dutifully informed the committee that a law ending birthright citizenship should and likely would survive constitutional challenge But consider the source a man who by his own account takes a very limited view of the power of the Supreme Court and breezily dismisses contrary precedentsRep Zoe Lofgren DCalif mentioned Graglias pickaninny comment and his position on busing After Lofgrens time expired Graglia blurted out Your bringing up  this alleged statement of pickaninny is in the nature of slur I dont know why youre bringing up these insulting things that have nothing to do with his testimonyMinutes later Rep Luis Gutierrez DIll read aloud some of Graglias other comments about minorities It seems some underhanded move is being made here the professor protested saying he never made a comment that in any way implied the inferiority of any groupThe congressman asked that Graglias past statements be entered into the record But Rep Lamar Smith RTex complained that the line of inquiry was a nongermane subject for this hearingOn the contrary it gets right at the heart of the matterRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
