President Obama nominated him for the post of US surgeon general the nations top spokesperson for public health back in November 2013 The Senate then promptly blocked his nomination for more than a year particularly after the National Rifle Association criticized a letter Murthy had cosigned in support of gun control measures Murthyonly got confirmed in December 2014 after some redstate Democrats who were losing their seats anyway decided to switch course and back himIn person however its harder to see how the mildtempered Murthy became such a lightning rod He meditates daily he told me to center myself a chance for me to remember who I want to be every day And hes starting his tenure with a listening tour that took him across America  rather than a push for any particular policies Indeed he has already said he wasnt interested in using his post as a bully pulpit for gun controlBefore his swearingin ceremony today I spoke with Murthy at length about what he sees as the biggest public health issues facing the country what he hopes to achieve as surgeon general and why the best ways to boost health may have nothing to do with medicineThe surgeon general is essentially the nations top spokesperson on health matters Past officeholders have often used the position to call attention to pressing public health issues such as smoking or obesity Murthy plans to do the same But though hes a physician by training he argues that institutions outside of medicine often have the biggest impact on public healthI first started thinking about that when I was practicing medicine Murthy says and I realized that I would sit in the clinic with patients or sit at their bedside and talk to them about changing their diet about improving their physical activity I would question how much of an impact I was having on their ultimate decisions about their lifestyle If you ask any doctor or nurse who has cared for patients they will often tell you they have had similar experiencesIts often our family and friends who can impact the choices we make around foodHe elaborated If we think about ourselves its often our family and friends who can impact the choices we make around food Its the food options that are available at work or in the cafeteria that might impact the choices we make during the third of our lives we spend at work It can be what we hear in church Sunday morning that impacts how we think about important issues in our societyThats why I have come to believe if we are going to overcome the great health challenges our country faces right now we have to do so with a coalition of leaders This includes not only doctors nurses and health professionals but also our employers schools faithbased organizations civic institutions and the various people and institutions in our country that actually impact decisions people make day to dayTake for instance the obesity crisis which Murthy has called one of his top priorities He argues that its not enough to engage doctors on this issue  employers faithbased organizations and other institutions need to play a role tooI want to make sure Im working with employers to make physical activity a greater part of work culture  recognizing that this not only has benefits for the physical health of employees but also positive effects on emotional wellbeing and mental function he saysThe same goes for mental health which needs to be addressed by institutions outside of medicine I want to work with faithbased leaders to address the negative attitudes associated with mental illness he explainsThis in general fits with Murthys broader approach to public health We have to do more than build hospitals and more clinics We have to invest in prevention and community prevention and recognize that institutions that dont have the word health in their name  faithbased groups employers schools  have a massive impact on the health decisions people make every day Thats why we have to engage these institutions in doing their part to improve healthSo how does Murthy focus on staying healthy I have four rules I follow for myself he saysOne is to eat healthy I tend to avoid salt added sugar and processed foods whenever possible and try to eat fresh fruits and vegetables as part of all my meals whenever possibleSecond is to stay physically active That means not just going to gym but incorporating activity into whatever I do whether thats taking the stairs or converting sitting meetings to walking meetings whenever possibleThird is making sure Im focusing on my emotional and mental wellbeing For me an important part of that is the meditation practice that I do every morning Its a chance for me to center myself a chance for me to remember who I want to be every dayThe fourth thing is I remind myself to stay away from toxic substances like tobacco and drugsThe surgeon general doesnt just promote public health From his perch Murthy will also likely have to play a role in combating misinformation I asked him about Dr Oz arguably the most famous health proselytizer in America who has come under fire for his use of pseudoscience I have never actually watched Dr Oz on TV so I cant really comment Murthy saysToo often doctors and nurses dont speak out when its needed the mostBut Murthy does agree that the public often faces a problem in sorting through all the health information out there In general when people think about diet and physical activity theres a lot of information out there and it can be very confusing for people Thats why I think its very important for us to understand the science behind the recommendations we make around diet and physical activityHe adds I have been on the road a lot these last few months One of the things that came up time and again was the pervasive misinformation that exists around certain hotbutton issues Diet is one of them In recent months in light of the measles outbreak there has also been some confusion around vaccinations That was an issue I spoke about a lot on the road helping people understand that when it comes to the measles vaccine its both safe and effective and theres no link to autismSo whats Murthys role in all this I will continue to make sure we are getting scientifically grounded messages out there to the public about questions that concern them the most he says But its not just the responsibility of the surgeon general but of every public health professional who understands science who is trained to evaluate evidence and who knows the cost we incur when patients are misinformed about the treatments they needToo often doctors and nurses dont speak out when its needed the most  when there are controversies around issues whether it be vaccines or ecigarettes or other health topics They can not only answer questions that the public may have but also push our institutions and policymakers and leaders to find answers when we dont have themMurthys mention of ecigarettes brought up a related question Ecigarettes are one of the biggest puzzles facing the medical community right now since the science behind them is still so nascent So how does he think about the issueOur scientific understanding of ecigarettes has been far outpaced by the actual use of ecigarettesOur scientific understanding of ecigarettes has been far outpaced by the actual use of ecigarettes Murthy says This means people are asking questions we dont always know the answers to Some of those questions are Do ecigarettes have adverse effects on health Do they lead children to be more open to smoking regular cigarettes And do they help with cessation for people who are current smokers These are questions we havent adequately answered yet through research  but we have to do so because as a recent CDC report showed ecigarettes use tripled over the last year among youth That to me is very concerning when we dont fully understand the potential adverse impacts of ecigarettesHe continues Should we promote or allow the use of ecigarettes by minors and by people who dont smoke at all This is where Im concerned We know nicotine is not a benign substance We know it has potential harmful effects on the body including the development of the adolescent brain Speaking as a regular person I would not want my children  if I were blessed enough to have children  to be exposed to nicotine unnecessarily whether thats through their smoking of ecigarettes or traditional cigarettes or whether that was through secondhand vapor or smokeIn April Murthy did a public service announcement on Sesame Street to remind kids to get vaccinated Can we expect more of that in the futureThe public service announcement we did with Elmo around vaccines was just one example of the different types of communication tools we want to use to make sure were getting the right message to kids and adults about health Murthy said But to make sure were reaching everybody  to use a variety of messengers messages channels We have to be creative about how we do itWhen it comes to obesity thinking about nutrition I want to work closely with our entertainment leaders and our leaders in sports to make sure were setting positive role models for kids in particular when it comes to choices around physical activity and nutrition
