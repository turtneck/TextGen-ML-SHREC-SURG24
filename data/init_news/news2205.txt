Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have among the highest unfavorability ratings of recent presidential candidates Their success shows how US politics is changingWill Trumps plan to register Muslims make it to The White HouseTesla under Trump How will electric cars fare under the next presidentJohn McCain defies Donald Trump on torture We will not waterboardAudience members listen as Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at Clinton Middle School Saturday in Clinton IowaIt is possible perhaps even probable that this falls election will be contested between two of three most disliked presidential candidates of at least the past quarter centuryAnd it is possible perhaps even probable that this is not a coincidenceA Gallup surveyreleased Saturday shows that Donald Trump has the highest unfavorability rating 60 percent of any presidential candidate since the polling firm started tracking the figure in 1992 For her part Hillary Clinton ranks third 52 percent with the nonewtaxesbreaking George HW Bush of 1992 at No 2In other words the 2016 presidential election could be decided between two people that the majority of Americans according to Gallup dont like politicallyHow is this possibleActually it makes complete sense In fact one could argue that such a contest would perfectly befit the current political eraAt a time when partisanship has taken new and more rigid forms the result has been an America increasingly wary of the other side Many Americans are increasingly motivated to voteagainstcandidates rather thanforthemMr Trump and former Secretary of State Clinton symbolize this shift in different ways but they speak to the shrinking middle of American politics As the national parties have less and less in common their national candidates likewise have less in common leaving voters with a starker choice that they are just as likely to oppose as embraceIndeed political scientists note that Americans are more neatly sortedinto the two parties than they have been in recent history In other words conservatives support Republicans and liberals support DemocratsNo more blue dog Democrats who want to reform welfare No more Northeast Republicans who want to address climate changeIt means there is a brighter line between the national Democratic and Republican Parties than there has been in decades because there is less internal pressure to moderate If increasingly everyone in the party is leftofcenter or rightofcenter the party naturally shifts left or rightThe result is two sharply different visions for America two sharply different sets of solutionsAnother result is the vanishing swing voter See the Monitors Cover Storyon the subject A larger share of American voters might register as independentsthan as Democrats or Republicans but they dont act that way Those independents who reliably turn out to vote tend to take sides just like the partisans voting in consistently partisan waysPeople are more confident in their opinions when they see polarized parties Corwin Smidt a Michigan State University political scientist told the Monitor They think Well if the choices are so stark its just not a gray area at all And so they worry about the other side winning according to research by Emory University political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster They found that voting behavior is increasingly guided by this negative partisanshipThis fall it seems American voters might have a lot to vote againstTrump has become the Republican frontrunner precisely because of his lack of broader appeal argues pollster Frank Luntzin the Financial TimesNo highpolling presidential candidate in the modern era has so intrepidly drawn the ire of so many within the American electorate he writes Yet in rendering one voting bloc utterly apoplectic he has appealed viscerally to another The balance of middle ground politics is not shall we say Mr Trumps bailiwickHis calls for the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and a temporary ban on all noncitizen Muslims entering the country are antithetical to those outside his conservative base which partly explains their appeal within itHes simply raising an important issue nobody else has the courage to talk about Mr Luntz adds paraphrasing the Trump voters reasons for supporting the billionaireFor Clinton the issue is less ideological than historical She is facing a perceived lack of trustworthinessthat dates back to her husbands administration  and has been exacerbated by her handling of State Department emailsYet the same trends that have vaulted Trump to frontrunner status are apparent in the Democratic primary process tooBernie Sanders could topple Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire And he is an avowed socialist talking about a revolutionIn Sanderss vision a massive grassroots uprising will shatter the constricting limits of todays political debate and thrust forward longtime liberal goals such as singlepayer health care and free publiccollege tuition writes Ronald Brownsteinin The Atlantic For Sanderss growing army its an exhilarating prospectFor Republicans it is appallingTo some degree this is what primaries do push candidates toward the extremes But there is a mounting sense that as the parties move further apart this year represents something new  or at least more intenseWhile the experience might be temporarily cathartic evidence suggests it might not be ultimately satisfying As Congress has become more sorted Americans confidence in it has declined Americans have less confidence in Congress than they do in any other major American institution  and have since 2010  according to a Gallup surveyAfter all a revolution entails one side winning  not likely in a political environment where each side is becoming more entrenched to stop the otherOn both sides the energy is with candidates  offering the dream of a clean sweep and a blank sheet on which to rewrite the nations priorities writes Mr Brownstein Yet because the candidates offering such fundamental change are largely misdiagnosing the reasons for todays impasse its unlikely they could break it even if they capture the presidencyTheir misdiagnosis Brownstein suggests that its unlikely one side can ignore the other to rewrite the nations prioritiesGiven the nations underlying partisan divisions the only way to advance bigger ideas may be through compromises across party lines that neither side is discussing much yetWhat this primary campaign has done perhaps is highlight the shifting political topography and distance between those party lines
