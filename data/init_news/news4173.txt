The Cuban flag is flying over the Cuban Embassy in the United States for the first time in 54 years after the two countries restored diplomatic relations in December but not everyone is celebrating the renewed flow of mojitos from the embassys Hemingway BarPresidential hopefuls Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush who both call the heavily CubanAmerican Miami area home denounced last Mondays new step in USCuba relationsHistory will remember July 20 2015 as Obamas Capitulation Monday the day two sworn enemies of the United States were able to outmaneuver President Obama to secure historic concessions Rubio who is of Cuban heritage stated also referencing the UN Security Councils endorsement of the Iran deal which happened last weekMondays events at the UN Washington and Havana leave no doubt that we have entered the most dangerous phase of the Obama presidency in which the president is flat out abandoning Americas vital national security interests to cozy up to the worlds most reprehensible regimes Rubio saidBetter judgment is called for in relations far and near Ninety miles to the south theres talk of a state visit by our outgoing president Bush said when he announced his candidacy But we dont need a glorified tourist to go to Havana in support of a failed Cuba We need an American president to go to Havana in solidarity with a free Cuban people and Im ready to be that presidentBush currently leads Rubio among CubanAmerican Republicans by double digits In a poll published July 18 of registered voters in MiamiDade County Bush led Rubio in CubanAmerican GOP votes by 12 percentage points 43 to 31 percent Ted Cruz whose father emigrated from Cuba received 7 percent of support in the pollsFlorida a swing state is an important part of any presidential candidates electoral vote calculus and CubanAmericans have long been a powerful group within Florida especially in MiamiDade County The Miami area is home to the largest population of Cuban heritage outside CubaBushs relative success among CubanAmericans in the polls with his slightly softer stance reflects a larger trend CubanAmericans are not as opposed to normalization as they were in the pastOnce a community known for standing in solidarity in support of the trade embargo steering US policy toward Cuba the CubanAmericans of MiamiDade are showing rifts in their political viewsIn a poll conducted in March 51 percent of CubanAmericans approved of Obamas plan to normalize relations with Cuba 40 percent disapproved Another poll conducted in the spring of 2014 by Florida International University pollsters found that 52 percent of CubanAmericans in MiamiDade favored ending the US embargo of CubaThats quite different from the pastIn the 1993 version of the same Florida International University poll 87 percent of CubanAmerican respondents in MiamiDade favored increasing international economic pressure on Cuba and 80 percent favored having no diplomatic relations with CubaThe changing CubanAmerican demographic may serve as a window into the groups changing opinions The number of CubanAmericans born in Cuba dropped from 68 percent in 2000 to 57 percent in 2013 according to the Pew Research CenterThe decrease in share of the Cubanborn CubanAmerican population matters because of the two groups differing political views In 2014 45 percent of those born in Cuba supported normalization compared with 66 percent of those born in the USThe emerging differences in views among the CubanAmerican community may also play a role in Democrats increasing ability to court its members While 70 percent of CubanAmericans polled in MiamiDade County were registered as Republicans in 1991 that number had fallen to 53 percent by May 2014 Another 25 percent in 2014 were registered as DemocratsIn the months since the Obama administration announced its policy change toward Cuba in December nearly every GOP presidential candidate has come out with a statement denouncing normalization Scott Walker Ted Cruz Lindsey Graham Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee have joined Bush and Rubio in denouncing the restoration of full diplomatic tiesRand Paul has been the only outlier a position that caused a scuffle with Rubio earlier this yearAfter 50 years of conflict why not try a new approach Paul wrote in a Dec 19 Facebook statement The United States trades and engages with other communist nations such as China and Vietnam Why not CubaPaul continued his statement to make a dig at Rubios strong stance against the presidents policySeems to me Senator Rubio is acting like an isolationist who wants to retreat to our borders and perhaps build a moat I reject this isolationism Paul wrote Finally lets be clear that Senator Rubio does not speak for the majority of CubanAmericans A recent poll demonstrates that a large majority of CubanAmericans actually support normalizing relations between our countriesRubio replied He has no idea what hes talking about on Fox News The Kelly FileDemocratic presidential hopefuls have openly praised the presidents steps toward normalizing USCuba relationsAs I have said the best way to bring change to Cuba is to expose its people to the values information and material comforts of the outside world Clinton said when Obama announced his plan on Dec 17 The goal of increased US engagement in the days and years ahead should be to encourage real and lasting reforms for the Cuban people And the other nations of the Americas should join us in this effortI applaud the president for beginning discussions to establish full diplomatic relations with Cuba just like most of the rest of the world This is a major step forward in ending the 55year Cold War with Cuba Sanders said in a statementWith CubanAmericans shifting opinions on normalizing relations the Democrats stance might just gain them a few more votes And the popular Republican opinion may not stand for many more election cycles
