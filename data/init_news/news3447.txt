Shobha Shukla Citizen News Service  CNS Hope for shorter and more effective new TB drugs License DMCA Multidrugresistant TB MDRTB remains a public health crisis As per WHOs Global TB Report 2016 480000 people fell ill with MDRTB in 2015 with 3 countries  India China and Russia  carrying the major burden and together accounting for nearly half of all MDRTB cases globally Detection and treatment gaps continue to plague the MDRTB response In 2015 only 1 out of every 5 people needing treatment for MDRTB were able to access it and only 52 of those who started MDRTB treatment were cured These sobering statistics remind us of our urgency to continue the fight to develop better faster and affordable treatments that will finally bring this pandemic under control said Dr Mel Spigelman CEO of TB Alliance which is working to advance several promising regimens to tackle all forms of TB The current MDRTB regimen lasts for 2 years or more It includes medicines and injectables that are not only toxic but also come at a cost that is higher than what many patients and healthcare systems can afford Even the new 9 month MDRTB regimen that has recently been endorsed by WHO though shorter does include 4 months of injectables However new results from 2 clinical studies conducted by TB Alliance point to an emerging paradigm where countries may soon have the short alloral and affordable drug regimens needed to treat all people with TB Late stage clinical results from these two studies were unveiled yesterday at the 47th Union World Conference on Lung Health in Liverpool The NC005 study  Advertisement  The NC005 study investigates an oral injection free regimen that purports to treat both drugsensitive and MDRTB with a short simple safe and affordable treatment A Phase 2b 2 month study tested various combinations of BPaMZBedaquiline B Pretomanid Pa Moxifloxacin M and Pyrazinamide Z It was conducted at 10 sites in 3 countries Uganda South Africa and Tanzania A total of 240 patients were enrolled in the study 180 patients with drugsensitive TB received BPaZ and 60 patients with MDRTB received BPaMZ The study also investigated a simpler dosing scheme for bedaquiline which could lead to fewer pills and an overall less complicated treatment for patients NC005 showed that the best regimen was a combination of all four drugs BPaMZ which was examined in an arm of the trial Data showed that at the end of 2 months clinical study participants receiving BPaMZ cleared TB bacteria from their sputum 3 times as quickly as those on the standard treatment regimen Almost all participants had culture conversion after the 2 months of treatment This is the fastest rate of culture conversion that has ever been seen and indicates the potential of BPaMZ to treat all forms of TBdrugsensitive as well as MDRTB with the same regimen The regimens appeared safe The study showed that it was possible to simplify the dosing of Bedaquiline and found that a daily dose of Bedaquiline 200 mg is at least as active and safe as the labelled dose This will allow for simpler daily dosing with the regimen and to be combined in a fixed dose combination The BPaMZ regimen is being tested to see if it can cure the vast majority of TB patients in as less as 3 months If successful the regimen could reshape the treatment landscape of TB especially for people with MDRTB who currently face an arduous 924 month treatment journey that is too often unsuccessful The results of NC005 could pave the way to a global Phase 3 trial The NixTB Study Nix means to put an end to  Advertisement  It is estimated that 9 of all the MDRTB patients suffer from extensively drugresistant TB XDRTB that is resistant to at least four commonly used antiTB drugs XDRTB is often considered a death sentence Most XDRTB is not treated at all because of the cost and complexity of the treatment Of those who do receive treatment less than one third get cured In May 2015 TB Alliance and partners launched the worlds first clinical study the NixTB Studyto test a new XDRTB drug regimen called BPaL consisting of Bedaquiline B Pretomanid Pa and Linezolid L in patients who have no other treatment options It is the first study to test an alloral drug regimen comprised of drugs with minimal preexisting resistance that has the potential to shorten simplify and improve treatment for XDRTB NixTB is an openlabel study that is being conducted at 2 sites in South Africaat Sizwe Hospital in Johannesburg and at Brooklyn Chest Hospital in Cape Town Additional sites to expand the study are planned Patients who have XDRTB or have failed their current MDRTB treatment or who have side effects of their current MDRTB treatment are enrolledTill to date 50 patients have been enrolled in the study including patients as young as 14 and those who are coinfected with HIV with a CD4 cell count of 50 or higher
