Fourthgraders and eighthgraders across the United States lost ground on national mathematics tests this year the first declines in scores since the federal government began administering the exams in 1990Reading performance also was sobering Eighthgrade scores dropped according to results released Wednesday while fourthgrade performance was stagnant compared with 2013 the last time students took the testAnd the tests again show large achievement gaps between the nations white and minority students as well as between poor and affluent children an indication that the nations disadvantaged students are not gaining ground despite more than a decade of federal law designed to boost their achievementResearchers have long cautioned that it is difficult to identify the cause of any fluctuation in scores on this testing program the National Assessment of Educational Progress NAEP which is also known as the Nations Report Card But many people look to NAEP scores as an important barometer of US student achievement because they are the only exams that have been given nationwide over a long period of time capturing the performance of rich and poor children of all ethnicities in urban suburban and rural communitiesThe years declines come amid a period of great tumult in American public educationRecent demographic shifts mean that schools are grappling with the challenge of educating an increasing number of students who come from lowincome families and are learning how to speak English And in recent years most states have adopted sweeping educational policy changes including teacher evaluations tied to test scores and Common Core academic standards that have changed what and how students learn in the classroomUS Education Secretary Arne Duncan defended those policies in a call with reporters Tuesday saying that massive changes in schools often lead to a temporary drop in test scores while teachers and students adjust But the new standards and other policies Duncan said are poised to improve student achievement  and students lives  in the long terdatamBig change never happens overnight Duncan said Im confident that over the next decade if we stay committed to this change we will see historic improvementsRandi Weingarten president of the American Federation of Teachers said that slipping NAEP scores are evidence that the nations focus on using standardized tests to judge teachers and schools has failed The scores should trigger a change of course she said pointing to the Obama administrations acknowledgment that students are spending too much time taking standardized tests of dubious valueNot only is there plenty of anecdotal evidence that our kids have suffered these latest NAEP scores again show that the strategy of testing and sanctioning coupled with austerity does not work Weingarten said in a statementStudy says standardized tests are overwhelming the nations public schoolsStudents at US public and private schools have taken the NAEP every two years since the early 1990s The exam is the countrys most consistent measure of K12 progress and because it has been in place for so long it can offer insight into the effects of demographic and policy changesBut researchers caution that deeper analysis is needed to understand the potential causes of this years drop And they said its too soon to tell whether the results are the beginning of a trend or just a blipThe new results  on a scale of 0 to 500  show twopoint losses in eighthgrade math and reading and a onepoint drop in fourthgrade math Fourthgrade reading scores were statistically unchangedScores have risen considerably since the first exams in the 1990s and despite this years declines are still among the highest posted by American studentsThe 2015 scores show that 64percent of fourthgraders and 66percent of eighthgraders are not considered proficient in reading In math 60percent of fourthgraders and 67percent of eighthgraders are not considered proficientThe new data also show how states and 21 large cities fared Individual state performance mirrored the nations with more states showing scores that dropped rather than increased The news from cities was somewhat more positive On average performance among urban school systems was flat compared with 2013Maryland had some of the largest drops in the nation and was the only state to see declines in both subjects at both grade levels They came as Maryland tested many more students with disabilities and nonnative English speakers than before bringing it in line with other statesMaryland sees one of the largest declines in the nation The District bucked the national trend posting some of the biggest increases in the country at the fourthgrade level Eighthgrade scores were flat It was the second time in a row that the city whose school system long had a reputation as one of the nations most troubled has stood out for its improvement on the NAEPDC Schools Chancellor Kaya Henderson attributed the success in part to the citys early adoption of the Common Core State Standards She also credited consistency of leadership  Henderson is in her sixth year as chancellor  and the citys investment in universal preschool for 3 and 4yearoldsThe highestscoring state in three of the four tests was Massachusetts which has often topped NAEP rankings Minnesota New Hampshire and Vermont also were top performers in 2015 New Mexico and Mississippi were among the lowestscoringMatthew Chingos a researcher at the Urban Institute said it is not very useful to compare overall state scores to one another because states are educating such different populations of students A state with a more challenging student population can be doing a relatively good job with those students but still trail states with student populations that are whiter or more affluentFor example in 2013 fourthgrade students who were learning English as a second language scored higher in Texas than they did in Oregon while other students in the two states scored about the same according to a brief Chingos published MondayBut Texas has far more nonnative English speakers than Oregon so its overall NAEP score was lowerIf you want to compare across states if you want to say how kids in Massachusetts versus Mississippi are doing you really do need to make these adjustments said ChingosIt can have a big impact on which states are doing better and which are doing worse
