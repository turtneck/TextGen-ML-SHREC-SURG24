CNN The Democratic Party gathered in Philadelphia on Thursday for the fourth night of its convention and CNNs Reality Check Team put the speakers statements and assertions to the testThe team of reporters researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speeches and selected key statements rating them true mostly true true but misleading false or its complicatedReality Check Clinton on Trumps I alone can fix it claimClinton emphasized the teamwork aspect she believes the presidency requires asking Isnt he forgetting troops on the front lines Police officers and firefighters who run toward danger Doctors and nurses who care for us  Hes forgetting every last one of us Americans dont say I alone can fix it We say Well fix it togetherWhile Clintons quote may be correct  Trump did say I alone can fix it  she took his remarks out of context In that portion of his speech Trump began by once again addressing Clintons email server scandal and commented that the FBIs lack of legal action against Clinton indicated that corruption has reached a level like never before He stated that his perspective made him the only person capable of preventing powerful politicians  like Clinton  from taking advantage of people that cannot defend themselvesTrumps full statement on being the only one able to fix this system included Nobody knows the system better than me which is why I alone can fix it I have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens just like it was rigged against Bernie SandersNotably the I and only I rhetoric is not new for Trump  he has frequently claimed he alone can solve Americas problems But in the context of his convention speech in which he references his perspective on Clintons alleged corruption we rate Clintons claim true but misleadingClinton applauded the Dallas communitys response to its police chiefs call for people to step up and join the police force to make a difference after the fatal shootings of five police officersPolice Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force maybe even join them she said And you know how the community responded Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days Thats how Americans answer when the call for help goes outAfter the July 7 shooting Dallas Police Chief David Brown called protesters to serve your communitiesWere hiring Get off that protest line and put an application in he said Well put you in your neighborhood and we will help you resolve some of the problems youre protesting aboutWhile her number is a hair high we rate Clintons claim trueClinton praised President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for turning around Americas economic fortunesOur economy is so much stronger than when they took office Nearly 15 million new privatesector jobs Twenty million more Americans with health insurance And an auto industry that just had its best year ever Thats real progress she saidWhen Obama took office in January 2009 the country was in the midst of the deepest economic downturn since the Great Depression Over the course of his administration the economy has grown 2 a year Its not spectacular growth but the economy is certainly stronger than during the recession We rate that claim as trueThe nation has added 148 million privatesector jobs between the low point of February 2010 and June 2016 according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data But if you look over Obamas two terms the nation is up only 98 million jobs We rate that claim as true but misleadingHealth Secretary Sylvia Burwell said in May that 20 million more people have coverage now thanks to Obamas signature health reform law It includes both people who have gained coverage on the Obamacare exchanges and through Medicaid expansion as well as young adults who have been able to stay on their parents plans until they turn 26 We rate that claim as trueThe auto industry sold more cars and trucks in 2015 than ever before We rate that clam as trueClinton attacked Trumps record saying In Atlantic City 60 miles from here you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his billsUSA Today looked at 60 lawsuits and more than 200 mechanics liens and interviewed businesses like an Atlantic City cabinet builder who claimed that the Trump Organization did not pay more than 80000 owed to him which started the closure of the builders business Hundreds of other contractors in the 1980s made similar claims Additionally the investigation found 21 citations against the nowdefunct Trump Plaza for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act in the same cityThe Wall Street Journal cited a wellknown controversy where contractors on Trumps Taj Mahal casino were told by the organization that they should agree to accept less than full payment or risk becoming unsecured creditors in bankruptcy court the paper reported A year later the Taj Mahal Casino went bankruptIn response to the reports Trump told USA Today in an interview that he only stiffs or shorts bills if the work is unsatisfactory and he told the Journal that he pays thousands of bills on timeThese are just cases in Atlantic City but both investigations cite examples in other cities such as Miami as wellBased on the reporting of these two news outlets we rate Clintons claim as trueKatie McGinty who is running for Senate from Pennsylvania said that when she was growing up hard work meant success but today that deal is off the tableMiddleclass families arent making a dime in real terms more than they were two decades ago But we know costs have been going through the roof she saidWhether this is true or not depends on your time frameThe most recent census data is from 2014 when median household income was 53657 Thats up 52 from 1994 when it was 51006However if you look at 20 years ago from today  or 1996  median income was 53345 While technically thats quite a few dimes higher it is essentially flatMcGinty is echoing a common refrain that wages have been stagnant in recent years Its true that median income is still lower than its preGreat Recession level peak of 57357 in 2007Median income however has risen over the past year or two according to estimates from Sentier Research which was founded by two former Census Bureau employees By June 2016 it had risen to 57206While their data doesnt go back 20 years it supports McGintys statement that median income has been flat over the longer term Sentier estimates the typical household earned 57826 in June 2000 the earliest month they looked atWe rate McGintys claim mostly true While median income rose 52 between 1994 and 2014 its roughly the same as it was in 1996 according to census data And Sentier Research found that median income in June 2016 is roughly the same as it was in 2000 And its true costs for many things have risen since thenLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti focused on the challenges faced by Americas cities Garcetti touted his citys action on raising the minimum wage In Los Angeles we saw too many Americans living in poverty so we became the biggest city in America to raise the minimum wage to 15 inspiring other cities and states to followOther cities also passed measures to raise the minimum wage including San Francisco San Diego Chicago and Seattle Seattle did so in 2013 before Los Angeles did and its 15 rate will be implemented sooner by 2018While LA was the largest city at the time to enact a minimum wage increase it is not yet up to 15 an hour as Garcetti implies Also other cities like New York will phase in the 15 rate sooner than LA willHenrietta Ivey a home care worker from Detroit praised Clinton as an advocate for a higher minimum wageI know she will fight to raise the minimum wage Ivey said In Michigan we are Fighting for 15 a 15 minimum wageClinton has indeed spoken out in support of setting a new bar for wages but she has waffled on the amount of the pay hike Last November she told an audience at a town hall in Iowa I favor a 12 minimum wage at the federal levelA week after the town hall she wrote a tweet with the hashtag Fightfor15 a hat tip to a grassroots labor group promoting a 15 minimum wage nationwideDuring a CNN debate in April moderator Wolf Blitzer pressed Clinton to clarify her plans for the federal minimum wage Clinton said that she was on board with the Fight for 15 movement but she then outlined some fine print prompting an extended backandforth with Bernie SandersI am sure a lot of people are very surprised to learn that you supported raising the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour Sanders saidClinton explained that her policy at the federal level would mirror New Yorks recent minimum wage increase which establishes a 15 floor for workers in the New York City metro area and a 1250 minimum wage for the rest of the state where the cost of living is lowerThe increases will be phased in over the next five years and there are different timetables for employers in the city suburbs and rural areas Small businesses have a more staggered schedule than large companies The New York law calls for pay statewide to eventually hit 15 but theres no established timeline yet for the increaseHillary Clinton supports a 12 federal minimum wage but believes that the federal minimum is just that and encourages states cities and workers through bargaining to go even higher including a 15 minimum wage in places where it makes sense the post saysIvey correctly states that Clintons platform includes a raise for lowwage workers so our verdict is true but its important to note that some geographic restrictions apply to her fight for 15Colorado Gov John Hickenlooper touted Colorados economic record Today Denver is the fastestgrowing big city in America and Colorado has the secondstrongest economy in the country he saidSince there are many ways to measure the strength of an economy and not all will show that Colorado is the second strongest Hickenloopers claim is mostly trueFormer Michigan Gov Jennifer Granholm praised Obama for helping the auto industry in its time of needObama saved the American auto industry Right and then that renewed auto industry paid America back in full Granholm saidThats not true actually When the Treasury Department closed the books on the 459 billion bailout of General Motors in December 2013 taxpayers had lost more than 10 billionUltimately though the government may have saved money The failure of GM and Chrysler would have cost the federal government between 39 billion to 105 billion in lost tax revenues as well as assistance to the unemployed according to a study by the Center for Automotive Research a Michigan think tankWe rate Granholms claim that the auto industry paid back taxpayers in full as falseReality Check Pelosi on Democrats looking like AmericaHouse Minority Leader Pelosi held up her caucus of Democrats in the House of Representatives as representative of the demographics of the country as a wholeWe are a caucus proud that we look like 21stcentury America over 50 women people of color and the LGBT community members she said What a contrast to the restricted club that met in convention in Cleveland last weekThat breaks down to 33 female 39 people of color and 3 LGBTThe Republican caucus in the House of Representatives has 22 women 11 people of color and no representatives who identify as LGBTThat means that women make up 89 of the 247person caucus and people of color make up 44 of the Republican representativesWe rate Pelosis claim as mostly true because the Democratic caucus falls short of representing women but is overrepresentative of people of color and those who identify as LGBTSocial studies teacher David Wils said Clinton would make college debt free for allSome context here Clintons final plan is the direct result of the push and pull between her and Sanders during the Democratic primary Sanders touted his plan for tuitionfree public college and Clinton at first offered only free community college tuitionWhen it was clear that Clinton was losing younger voters to Sanders she shifted her position and offered a new proposal for free tuition at public colleges but she added I dont want to make college free for Donald Trumps kids With these specifics her proposed plan does not cover families with household incomes over 125000 a year not exactly Donald Trumps kidsNBA legend Kareem AbdulJabbar says recent religious freedom acts are the opposite of what founding father Thomas Jefferson wantedIn brief remarks AbdulJabbar cited Jeffersons Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom one of his most famous and important worksIn 1777 Jefferson drafted the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom which later became a model for the First Amendment Todays socalled religious freedom acts like the one signed by Gov Mike Pence of Indiana they are the opposite of what Jefferson wanted because they allow discrimination AbdulJabbar saidSo are todays religious freedom bills the opposite of what Jefferson wantedThe statute passed by the Virginia General Assembly in January 1786 is seen as a precursor for First Amendment protections by declaring the need for separation of church and state and the right to exercise ones conscienceNo man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship place or ministry whatsoever nor shall be enforced restrained molested or burthened in his body or goods nor shall otherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief but that all men shall be free to profess and by argument to maintain their opinion in matters of religion and that the same shall in no wise diminish enlarge or affect their civil capacities Jefferson wroteProponents say it is a protection of First Amendment rights Opponents say it is discriminatoryAs Thomas Jefferson noted No provision in our Constitution ought to be dearer to man that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of civil authority Pence wroteAbdulJabbar didnt point to any particular passage in the statute but he might have been referring to Jeffersons view that our civil rights have no dependence on our religious opinions any more than our opinions in physics or geometryJefferson however believed that proscribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of trust and emolument unless he profess or renounce this or that religious opinion is depriving him injuriously of those privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellow citizens he has a natural rightHe also railed against compelling people to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannicalAs for Indianas religious freedom law it didnt seek to mandate a particular point of view but shield those holding certain beliefs from being legally liableFurthermore Jefferson was talking about the government discriminating against citizens His Virginia Statue doesnt say anything about protecting private citizens religious freedom from other individuals which is what the recent crop of religious freedom laws are arguably about At least thats what many state supreme courts have found for instance in the case of bakers and florists who refuse to service samesex weddingsWhether religious freedom laws are discriminatory is a matter of opinion but its certainly not clear that Jeffersons statute is at odds with them making AbdulJabbars claim far from a slam dunk We rate it falseThe Democratic Party  currently fighting to gain a majority in the Senate  gave Katie McGinty a big platform for her upcoming race at the last night of the DNC McGinty launched attacks against opponent Sen Pat Toomey  whom she will battle in November for a Pennsylvania seat  spotlighting his financial policy on a national stage Given the big audience our team decided McGintys claims deserved a fullblown Reality CheckMcGinty first emphasized Toomeys sixyear investment career claiming he had made his millions on Wall Street before launching into specific criticisms of his economic policyEven if you factor in generous bonuses it is unlikely Toomey topped 2 million as a trader He is however currently valued at 48 million by the Center for Responsive Politics  which given his career history almost certainly comes entirely from investment bankingFor these reasons we rate McGintys claim as trueMcGinty also delved into details on Toomeys voting record Hes still trying to sell us the same old trickledown Were not buying it We know that trickledown only benefits those who are already on the top Trust the stock market with your hardearned Social Security Pat Toomey says Trust the wheelers and dealers with your savings and you will be living largeAs for trusting the stock market with your hardearned Social Security McGinty is likely referring to Toomeys 2010 Social Security privatization proposal which targets a specific group of people Democrat Joe Sestak opposing Toomey in the 2010 midterm election accused him of putting Wall Street profits ahead of protecting Pennsylvania seniorsIf individuals did not want to participate Toomey said they could stay with the current system of a guaranteed benefit McGintys statement that Toomey encourages trusting the stock market with Social Security earnings is generally accurate but leaves out some important context regarding whom Toomeys philosophy targets That makes McGintys second claim true but misleadingTexas Rep Joaquin Castro said Trump has defended the internment of JapaneseAmericans during WWIICastros claim is rooted in comments the business mogul made last year to justify his proposed travel ban for Muslims Its a bit of a stretch to characterize Trumps statements as a defense of President Franklin D Roosevelts proclamations ordering the imprisonment of Japanese immigrants in the aftermath of Pearl HarborOn ABCs Good Morning America Trump said Roosevelt is remembered as a great president despite his legacy of Japanese internmentThis is a president who is highly respected by all said Trump If you look at what he was doing it was far worse than the travel banAs a follow up the candidate was asked whether he supported bringing back policies similar to Roosevelts wartime restrictionsI dont want to bring them back at all said Trump I dont like doing it at allDuring a separate appearance on MSNBCs Morning Joe Trump declined to say whether he thought the establishment of Japanese internment camps violated American valuesI dont want to respond Trump said You know why Thats not what were doingTrump can scramble words like Jackson Pollock splattered paint allowing for a broad array of interpretations to his patter But we cant find anything in his commentary that suggests he has a favorable view of Japanese internment We rate this claim false
