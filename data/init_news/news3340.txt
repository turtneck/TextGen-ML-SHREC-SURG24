THE BIG IDEAHillary Clinton and Donald Trump each reluctantly backed down last night on major things that threatened to derail their campaignsThe Clinton Foundation announced it will no longer accept donations from corporations or foreign entities if Hillary is elected president Bill Clinton told foundation staff that the final meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative will be held next month and he announced that he will stop giving paid speeches The former president who turns 70 on Friday said he will resign from the board and the foundation will only accept contributions from US citizens and independent charities according to the APs Ken Thomas who broke the storyMeanwhile Trump expressed remorse for the first time since he got into the race 14 months ago Sometimes in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues you dont choose the right words or you say the wrong thing I have done that the Republican nominee reading from a teleprompter said during a rally in Charlotte And believe it or not I regret it I do regret it particularly where it may have caused personal pain Both candidates are extraordinarily reluctant to ever acknowledge wrongdoing even tacitly because they believe doing so projects weakness This is why last night was so remarkable and may represent a true pivot point in the raceThink about Clintons evolving explanations for her private email server through the 2016 cycle and her defense of her support for the Iraq War during the 2008 race it took her until 2014 to say a 2002 vote was a mistakeThere are literally dozens of examples of Trump hurting himself by refusing to admit that he went too far Think about his attacks on Gold Star parents Khizr and Ghazala Khan John not a war hero McCain Judge Gonzalo Curiel and Ted Cruzs father Rafael whom he claimed was with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before John F Kennedys assassination He also declined to express regret after mocking a reporter with a disability and calling Mexican immigrants rapists Hillary has now implicitly acknowledged that the Clinton Foundation is a major liability to her campaign regardless of her campaigns spin and inevitable denialsThe decision comes amid mounting criticism of how the foundation operated during her tenure as secretary of state potentially allowing donors to seek special access through her government post Abby Phillip and Rosalind S Helderman reportDonald a former donor to the group often accuses Hillary of engaging in paytoplay practices In particular he says the 25 million the foundation took from Saudi Arabia undercuts his opponents rhetoric on womens rightsBut hes inconsistent about his messaging He also often levels unsubstantiated charges that overshadow any accurate lines of attack and make it easier for the war room in Brooklyn to push back by muddying the waterA traditional GOP opponent running a disciplined campaign and spending meaningful money on negative TV ads could probably more effectively use the Clinton Foundation as a bludgeon to depict HRC as a shady shakedown artist who looks out more for her rich cronies and deeppocketed foreigners than workingclass Americans struggling to catch a break Message testing and focus groups including those conducted by Democrats have shown there are some particularly potent and totally true lines of attack Among them There is no evidence that Hillary Clinton or her top aides completed ethics training when they started at the State Department as required by federal law McClatchys Anita Kumar reported yesterday State Department records show only three of nine top Clinton aides took the mandated training for new employees Records also suggest that none of seven top aides required to take subsequent annual training completed it No records indicate whether Clinton herself took any training Many of the aides still work for Clinton Clintons campaign did not respond to questions Clinton has been getting hammered in the court of elite opinion The Posts Editorial Board lamented the porous ethical wall between the Foundation and the State Department in a Sunday editorial As secretary she pledged to keep her official world and her familys foundation separate and she failed to keep them separate enough Such sloppiness would not be acceptable in the White House A Tuesday editorial in the Boston Globe that went further calling for the Clinton Foundation to shut down altogether went viralItd be impossible to keep the foundation open without at least the appearance of a problem former Pennsylvania governorEd Rendell a close Clinton ally told the New York Daily News last week Last night showed that Kellyanne Conway is now calling the shots In covering this weeks shakeup the 202 has primarily focused on Breitbart executive Stephen Bannon becoming the campaigns chief executive and probably has given insufficient attention to Conway taking over as managerConway is a pollster who specializes in helping conservative men reach out to women In early July she told our Danielle Paquette that she didnt like Trumps namecalling and said she really wants him to avoid criticizing peoples looks and mental capacity Maybe she said its just the mother in me The full piece is worth rereadingWeve written a lot about Bannons push to let Trump be Trump but clearly Conway is trying to talk some political sense into the candidate and explaining how much his insultladen approach has damaged his standing with the women who will decide this election But there are many reasons to doubt the sincerity of Trumps 11thhour conversion Hes clearly desperate to turn around his sinking campaign and he did not specify last night what he was apologizing for or to whom And just like the man who faux apologizes to his wife by saying Im sorry youre mad Trump at one point couched his penchant for divisive rhetoric by saying Sometimes I can be too honest Was he being too honest when he laced into McCain Curiel and the Khans Trump has until very recently refused to express any regret for what he said about them What changed It was the third time in the past four days that Trump read a speech off a teleprompter a practice he once routinely mocked He clearly did not write the words he uttered The language and tone sounded nothing like him The humility he expressed last night is part of a broader and renewed effort to rebrand Trump as more presidential Jose A DelReal Robert Costa and Jenna Johnson report That effort will continue today with a trip to Louisiana to tour flooded areas Conway said on CNN yesterday that Trump will finally begin preparing for the first debate this weekend evidence that the candidate recognizes he must deliver a command performance to keep his hopes alive How long can this last We still believe that the 70yearold is at heart fundamentally incapable of changing It is hard to imagine him going on some kind of apology tour and becoming selfdisciplined in a sustained way Hes plainly happiest when hes feuding with someone and putting down othersWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING Trumps first TV ad of the general election which will begin airing today focuses on immigration The campaign says

a gun pulled on them by a security guard after reportedly damagingproperty at a gas station in Rio From Dave Sheinin Dom Phillips and Joshua PartlowAn officialapologyOvernightthe US Olympic Committee issued a statement that acknowledged a version of events that involved an argument spurred by an act of vandalismcommitted by one of the athletesThe statement concluded by saying We apologize to our hosts in Rio and the people of Brazil for this distracting ordeal in the midst of what should rightly be a celebration of excellenceAn attorney for Jimmy Feigen said he will pay more than 10000 to a Brazilian charity to leave the country Under Brazilian law his attorney said a donation can be made to avoid criminal prosecution He did not say what charge was potentially facing Feigen Matt BonesteelLochte remainsin the US having left Rio on Tuesday and teammates Gunnar Bentz andJack Conger were cleared to leave last night What really happenedThe incident appears to have stemmed from a drunken pit stop at a gas station bathroomaround 6 am Surveillance footage appears to show at least one of the swimmers  pull off the metal door to the bathroom In the video gas station employees observe the athletes then escort them out of the bathroom In another clip from a different camera angle the athletes quickly seat themselves on the ground and raise their hands as if ordered by a person with a gunThe police chief confirmed a guard had produced a firearm to contain the swimmers so they could not leave without paying damages The firearm was used in a situation in which they were contained When they were contained the firearm was put away he said Brazilians have reacted with anger and indignation at an apparently false crime report that only served to boost the perception of Rio de Janeiro as a lawless chaotic city that was unprepared to host an Olympics The city police chief said Lochte and the others owed Rio an apology for having stained the city for a fantasy As the American swimmers left the police station Thursday evening they were swarmed by a crowd of journalists amid shouts of liars by some in English The Posts Sally Jenkins eviscerates Lochte as the dumbest bell that ever rang in a spotoncolumn Two things are going on here Lochtes selfpromoting prevarications and the sensitivity of Rio authorities who have been portrayed as incapable of keeping athletes safe amid other Olympic breakdowns There have been a lot of genuine robberies of Olympic athletes and officials The police need to show that fears are overstated and these Games are secure  though they are not particularly  and the stupid Americans offered them something with which to save face Lochtes conceit intersected with a delicate political issue and it made a perfect storm His claim to NBC that men posing as police pulled over the taxi and he heroically resisted the robbers with a gun pressed to his forehead was an especially ludicrous detail  and the very thing that drew the attention of authorities who know full well that anyone who defies a bandit in Rio gets shot on the spot and they dont leave you with your cellphone Lochtes done as a public figure of course Which is probably the most effective form of justice for someone who apparently so craves attention Oblivion is what he deserves How its playing in the tabloids One of the things that makes theLochte mess so

fallen she has had a concussion Pierson charged on MSNBC Dysphasia is defined as the loss of or deficiency in the power to use or understand language as a result of injury to or disease of the brain Piersons accusations come after Clintons campaign has refuted the conspiracy theories releasing multiple factchecking articles and a statement from Clintons doctor saying she is in excellent health

Apprentice For Trump The Apprentice  and later The Celebrity Apprentice  helped reestablish him as a national figure after his fall into debt and corporate bankruptcies in the 1990s Onscreen Trump was a wise tough businessman And at times a kindhearted philanthropist  willing to give away thousands on a whim Onair Trump seemed to be explicit that this wasnt TV fakery The money he was giving was his own Out of my wallet Trump said in one case Out of my own account he said in another But when the cameras were off the payments came from other peoples money The Post tracked all the personal gifts that Trump promised on the show but could not confirm a single case in which Trump actually sent a gift from his own pocketIn 2012 Trump became more generous on the air  giving six 10000 donations in a single episode in one example His gifts brought one insult comedian to tears But a mystery remained What happened in 2012 to make Trump so much more generous on the air In the tax records of the Trump Foundation  there is no record of a donation from Trump himself in 2012 But in 2012 the Trump Foundations records show a large gift from NBC the network that aired the show That was more than enough to cover all the foundations gifts to Celebrity Apprentice contestants charities both before 2012 and since For NBC Trumps personal donations made for better TV  giving uplifting notes to the firings and burnishing the reputation of Trump the shows star Did NBC give Trumps foundation money so that Trump could appear to be more generous oncamera Tom Hamburger Dana Priest and Andrew Roth have the backstory on how Trumps campaign chairmanrevived his career  and his business fortunes  in Ukraine Manaforts 2005 entry into Ukrainian politics and finances came when he signed on as an adviser to the steel magnate Rinat Akhmetov one of Ukraines richest oligarchs and a key supporter of Yanukovych and the Party of Regions  Manaforts first job was to burnish the local and international reputation of a company owned by Akhmetov based in the Russianspeaking industrial Donetsk region Over time Manaforts role with the party expandedAs Manafort built a political consulting practice in Ukraine he also developed financial connections with wealthy figures in the region some of whom face ongoing scrutiny from the Justice Department  In 2008 he tried to develop an 850 million Manhattan luxury apartment project with Dmitry Firtash a Ukrainian energy tycoon with a history of legal trouble US prosecutors charged Firtash in 2013 with moneylaundering and bribery  In another business venture Oleg Deripaska a Russian aluminum magnate accused Manafort in a court in the Cayman Islands of taking nearly 19 million intended for investments then not accounting for the money Manafort insisted he had cut his ties with his Ukrainian client in 2014 But former colleagues however say he continued to work for the party and was seen in the country as recently as October Ukraine Releases More Details on Payments for Trump Aide from the New York Times The Ukrainian authorities under pressure to bolster their assertion that oncesecret accounting documents show cash payments from a proRussian political party earmarked for Manafort on Thursday released lineitem entries some for millions of dollars The former party member Vitaly A Kalyuzhny for a time chairman of the Ukraine Parliaments International Relations Committee had signed nine times for receipt of payments designated for Manafort according to Serhiy A Leshchenko a member of Parliament who has studied the documents The ledger covered payments from 2007 to 2012 when Mr Manafort worked for the party and its leader Viktor F Yanukovych Ukraines former president who was deposed Trump advisers waged covert influence campaign by the APs Jeff Horwitz and Chad Day A firm run by Trumps campaign chairman directly orchestrated a covert Washington lobbying operation on behalf of Ukraines ruling political party attempting to sway American public opinion in favor of the countrys proRussian governmentManafort and his deputy Rick Gates never disclosed their work as foreign agents as required under federal law The lobbying included attempts to gain positive press coverage of Ukrainian officials in the NYT WSJ and the AP Another goal undercutting American public sympathy for the imprisoned rival of Ukraines thenpresidentThe emails appear to contradict the assertion that the nonprofits lobbying campaign operated independently from Manaforts firm In papers filed in the US Senate Mercury and the Podesta Group listed the European nonprofit as an independent nonpolitical client The firms said the center stated in writing that it was not aligned with any foreign political entity The emails show that Gates personally directed two Washington lobbying firms  to set up meetings between a top Ukrainian official and senators and congressmen on influential committees involving Ukrainian interests Gates noted in the emails that  Ukraines foreign minister did not want to use his own embassy in the United States to help coordinate the visits And Gates directed efforts to undercut sympathy for Yulia Tymoshenko an imprisoned rival of thenPresident Viktor YanukovychMORE FALLOUT FROMTHE BREITBARTIZATION OF THE GOP Former Breitbart News spokesman Kurt Bardella slammed StephenBannon for regularly disparaging minorities women and immigrants  saying editorial meetings for the publication often sounded like a white supremacist rally This is someone who has a very low moral compass he said on ABCs Powerhouse Politics podcast and the idea that this is the type of person that Donald Trump as the Republican nominee as president would have closest to him is very disturbing Bannons ascension to the post of Trump campaign CEO represents a dangerous seizure of the conservative movement by the altright anotherexBreitbart employeeBen Shapirowrites in an oped for The Post It comes as a surprise  or at least it should  that the RNC appears ready to go along with the BannonBreitbartTrump takeover over the party even as the Trump campaigns latest move means RNC Chairman Reince Priebus now sits effectively side by side with altright Trump fans  Broad swaths of the altright by contrast believe in a creedfree racebased nationalism insisting among other things that birth on American soil confers superiority The altright sees limitedgovernment constitutionalism as pass it holds that only nationalist populism on the basis of shared tribal identity can save the country Its a movement shot through with racism and antiSemitism Now it is this is the cast of characters and their enablers to whom Trump has turned Bannon is  the guy who ushered along the twisted turn at Breitbart If Republicans arent careful hell inflict similar damage on their party now that hes the top man running their standardbearers campaign Reacting to Trump bringing on Bannon Stuart Stevens Mitt Romneys chief strategist in 2012 told Bloomberg This is the bunker scene in Downfall only the Trump crowd wont tell Hitler the truth Its utter madness Trump is a nut and he likes to surround himself with nuts Bannonis already making animprintThe Trump campaign hired an exSarah Palin aide Pam Pryor to oversee its faith and Christian outreach per theWall Street Journal A secretive donor has more sway than ever over Trumps orbit The New York Times Nicholas Confessore reports on how his deeppocketed family helped put the shakeup into motion and now has close allies in positions of authority Bannons ascension on Wednesday  urged on Mr Trump by Rebecca Mercer among others  shows how a cadre of strategists super PACs and political organizations quietly nurtured by her family have emerged to play a pivotal role in Mr Trumps presidential campaign Over more than half a decade Ms Mercers father the New York investor Robert Mercer has carved an idiosyncratic path through conservative politics spending tens of millions of dollars to outflank his own partys consultant class and unnerve its established powers His fortune has financed think tanks and insurgent candidates super PACs and media watchdogs lobbying groups and grassroots organizations Many of them are now connected one way or another to Mr Trumps presidential bid Mr Trumps new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway is a veteran Republican pollster who previously oversaw a super PAC financed by the Mercers And Bannon oversees Breitbart a company to which Mercer reportedly invested 10 million several years ago and likely still has a stakeWHEN IN DOUBT BLAME THE MEDIA In Charlotte last night Trump said the media created some of the controversies that have dogged him The establishment media doesnt cover what really matters in this country or whats really going on in peoples lives he said They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said In New Hampshire yesterday Mike Pence said the press  not Trump  is to blame for the tickets slide in the polls Just about every day the national media latches onto some issue about my running mate It really does the Indiana governor said in Manchester I mean the media is so busy parsing every word that Donald Trump said in the last 30 minutes they dont have time to cover what the Clintons have been up to for the last 30 years TimeBUT AT WHAT COST An important factor in the rise of Trump Only 32 percent of Republicans trusted the media a great deal or a fair amount in Gallup polling from last year which is one reason so many of the tough stories on Trump have been tuned out by his supporters Weve created this monster Business Insiders Oliver Darcy posted the transcript of a thoughtprovoking interview he did with conservative Wisconsin radio host Charlie Sykes a prominent critic of the GOP nominee about how significant distrust of the media has been in both the rise and resilience of Trump Its worth reading in fullWeve basically eliminated any of the referees the gatekeepers Sykes said Theres nobody Lets say that Donald Trump basically makes whatever you want to say whatever claim he wants to make And everybody knows its a falsehood The big question of my audience it is impossible for me to say that By the way you know its false And theyll say Why I saw it on Allen B West Or theyll say I saw it on a Facebook page And Ill say The New York Times did a fact check And theyll say Oh thats The New York Times Thats bullexpletive Theres nobody  you cant go to anybody and say Look here are the facts And I have to say thats one of the disorienting realities of this political year You can be in this alternative media reality and theres no way to break through it And I swim upstream because if I dont say these things from some of these websites then suddenly I have sold out Then theyll ask whats wrong with me for not repeating these stories that I know not to be trueWhen this is all over we have to go back Theres got to be a reckoning on all this Weve created this monster Sykes added And look Im a conservative talk show host All conservative hosts have basically established their brand as being contrasted to the mainstream media So we have spent 20 years demonizing the liberal mainstream media And by the way a lot of it has been justifiable There is a real bias But at a certain point you wake up and you realize you have destroyed the credibility of any credible outlet out there And I am feeling to a certain extent that we are reaping a whirlwind at that And I have to look in the mirror and ask myself To what extent did I contribute Ill be honest the bias of the mainstream media has been a staple for every conservative talk show host every conservative pundit for as long as I can remember Going way back into the 1960s with William F Buckley Jr Clinton told FBI investigatorsthat Colin Powell advised her to use a private email account The account is included in the notes the Federal Bureau of Investigation handed over to Congress on Tuesday relaying details behind the FBIs decision not to charge Clinton the New York TimessAmy Chozick reports Separately in a 2009 email exchange that also emerged during the FBI questioning Mrs Clinton who had already decided to use private email asked Mr Powell about his email practices when he was the nations top diplomat under George W Bush according to a person with direct knowledge of Mr Powells appearance in the documents Clinton held a closeddoor meeting with top law enforcement officers from around the country in New York seeking to discuss policing and racial tensions that have been exposed by recent killings John Wagner and Abby Phillip Its obvious that recent events  from Dallas and Baton Rouge to Milwaukee and across the country  underscore how difficult and important the work is ahead of us to repair the bonds of trust and respect between our police officers and our communities Clinton said before dismissing reporters We have to be cleareyed about the challenges we face We cant ignore them and certainly we must not inflame themClinton has sought to toe a somewhat narrow line expressing support for officers while sympathizing with the concerns of Black Lives Matter activists and others outraged by discriminatory conduct

untrue  and told another that bankers debt was canceled by the Troubled Asset Relief Program The two also answered to several campaign gaffes  moderator Chris Cuomo pushed Baraka on why he had
