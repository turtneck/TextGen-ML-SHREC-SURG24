Sunday nights Democratic debate was DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz insisted timed to maximize the opportunity for voters to see our candidates Given that it was held on the Sunday before a federal holiday that seems  dubious But whoever wasnt deterred by the debates inauspicious timing saw an event that was both substantive and sort of lackadaisical Almost all the discussion focused on policy but Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton began awkwardly attempting to slip in attacks on each other though neither really seemed that comfortable doing it The most animated of the bunch was Martin OMalley who seemed energized by his quest to successfully say something anything without being talked overItll take a few days for poll results to trickle in which will provide the closest thing to an objective answer of who actually won the debate But in the meantime here are the candidates who ended the night better off than they started it  and the ones who slippedBernie is now posting his best poll numbers of the campaign to date as he excitedly pointed out in a moment that echoed Donald Trumps matteroffact citation of polling at Thursdays Republican debate Hes only 4 points behind in Iowa and gaining solidly ahead in New Hampshire and has momentum nationally too Theres a very real possibility that he wins the first two primary contests and leaves Clinton scrambling to recover in South CarolinaWhat Sanders needed to do Sunday night was maintain that momentum continue his appeal to liberal base voters and blunt any attacks that Clinton might be tempted to unleash at him He accomplished all of that even if he didnt give a focused dominant performance His release of his singlepayer financing details denied Clinton a major attack line he avoided getting bogged down in guns clearlyhis worst issue from the Democratic bases perspective and he struck an ecumenical tone that made him seem relatively above the fray as Clinton tried out various critiques targeting himPerhaps his strongest moment was when he erupted at Andrea Mitchell after being asked about Bill Clintons affairsAndrea Mitchell Senator Sanders let me ask you a question you called Bill Clintons past transgressions quote totally totally totally disgraceful and unacceptable Senator do you regret saying that Bernie Sanders I was asked a question  you know one of the things Andrea that question annoys me I cannot walk down the street Secretary Clinton knows that without being told how much I have to attack Secretary Clinton To get me on the front page of the paper I have to make a vicious attack I have avoided doing that Im trying to run an issueoriented campaign Applause I was asked a question Andrea Mitchell You didnt have to answer it that way though why did you Bernie Sanders Then if I dont theres another front page Yes and I mean this seriously weve been through this Yes his behavior was deplorable have I said a word No I have not Im going to debate Secretary Clinton Governor OMalley on the issues facing the American people not Bill Clintons personal behaviorThis appeals to older Democrats still pissed at the medias preoccupation with Bills sexual misconduct while still reminding people of it and condemning it as deplorable It makes him seem above such frivolity and interested in waging a positive issueoriented campaignBest of all Clinton didnt get a chance to respond even though her campaign attacked Sanders this week for appearing to go negative in one TV spot After a debate when she clearly went negative at Sanders  and a week in which a notable surrogate attacked him not on the issues but for his age  this made Clinton seem threatened by Sanders and desperate to attack him as he brushed off the attacks and pivoted to the issuesOh yeah and this is the first debate in which Bernie got the most speaking time of any candidate beating Clinton by two and a half minutesIt was only eight years ago that Hillary Clinton was repeatedly attacking Barack Obama as a dangerously inexperienced naif who would be unable to get anything of consequence done as president Now she presents herself as a defender of his sundry accomplishments and attacks Sanders for being insufficiently supportive of the presidentThe fact is we have the Affordable Care Act Clinton declared That is one of the greatest accomplishments of President Obama of the Democratic Party and of our country and we have already seen 19 million Americans get insurance She also cited Sanderss past criticisms of the president and flirtation with supporting a primary challenge against him in 201112Clintons message is clear I am the true defender of Obamas legacy I will preserve his gains while Sanders dismissed themSanders replied not by defending his past critiques of Obama but by distancing himself from them and insisting hes a huge fan of the president In 2006 when I ran for the Senate Senator Barack Obama was kind enough to campaign for me 2008 I did my best to see that he was elected and in 2012 I worked as hard as I could to see that he was reelected He and I are friends weve worked together we have differences of opinionAs for Clintons claims that he would threaten the Affordable Care Act he rebutted Were not going to tear up the Affordable Care Act I helped write it Sanders isnt disavowing Obamas legacy at all Hes embracing it and selling himself as the natural person to build on itOMalley made the same point in his introduction declaring We need to come together as a people and build on the good things that President Obama has doneThe Democratic primary then is a competition among three people all of whom embrace Obamas legacy celebrate it as a huge success and differ only on the matter of whos best equipped to defend and expand his accomplishments No matter who wins that this is the debate goes to show just how beloved Obama remains within the Democratic Party and how he and his presidency will continue to define the partys mission for years after hes left officeSanderss spat with Mitchell aside the moderating Sunday night was about as strong as its been at any debate for either party this entire cycle Mitchell and Lester Holt held the line against candidates talking over each other and speaking past their time limits and Holt especially was willing to ask followup questions when candidates were evasive When Sanders avoided a question about why he flipflopped aboutlawsuit immunity for gun companies Holt pressed him Senator you didnt answer the question that you did change your position on immunity for gun manufacturers Can you answer the question as to whySimilarly when Sanders positioned himself as tougher on Wall Street than Clinton Holt didnt just ask Clinton to reply he framed the reply to ensure it was more useful to viewers Secretary Clinton help the voter understand the daylight between the two of you hereMost importantly almost all of their questions were substantive policyoriented and designed to not be answerable simply by reference to candidates past statements Sanders may have largely dodged Mitchells question about how he accounts for the failure of singlepayer in Vermont  despite Mitchells great efforts to force him to answer it  but it was a perfect angle It doesnt get Sanders to regurgitate his stump speech but it forces him to engage with the actual implementation challenges his Medicareforall proposal facesHolt and Mitchell served as a reminder of what engaged moderating meant to inform viewers rather than provoke conflict or appease campaigns through lax timing rules looks like Future moderators would do well to follow the example they setAt the risk of sounding tautological Clinton lost by not winning The trends arent in her favor at the moment Sanders is gaining in Iowa and is starting to be treated like a serious candidate by the press Her attempts to attack Sanderss support for singlepayer health care this week were widely perceived as backfiring especially among liberal primary voters who might be tempted to support Clinton out of practicality She needed a debate in which she could show that Sanders was out of his depth not someone you could plausibly see actually functioning as president She didnt do that this time aroundInstead she had a debate where she tried to throw everything she could at him to see what stuck She tried the singlepayer attack but given that Bernie released his plan before the debate it sounded more convoluted than effective I have to say Im not sure whether were talking about the plan you just introduced tonight or were talking about the plan you introduced nine times in the Congress OuchShe tried attacking Sanders as insufficiently proObama largely for reasons related to Wall Street reform which generally didnt sound that persuasive Hearing that Obama took Wall Street money isnt likely to make primary voters think Hmm a guy I like took money from bankers clearly I should vote for Hillary Clinton who also takes money from bankers It just raises the visibility of the fact that Hillary Clinton gets finance money and Sanders doesnt  which on the margins is going to bring a lot more people to Sanderss column than to ClintonsHer gun attack was pointed and strong raising all of Sanderss key failings in quick successionIt was probably the best hit she got against Sanders in the whole debatePoor guy The former Maryland governor began his remarks with My name is Martin OMalley  a cringeworthy reminder that many primary voters dont even know who he is or that hes running for president And he didnt get a lot of opportunities to change that situation throughout the evening Take a look at the speaking time chart againEven OMalleys protests that he wasnt being heard wound up getting ignoredMartin OMalley literally asked for the ability to speak for 10 seconds and Lester Holt answered him NoBy then end of the debate you could see sheer shock and gratitude on his face when it came to closing statements Before we leave is there anything you wanted to say tonight that you havent gotten a chance to say And well start with Gov OMalley Holt said Didnt see that coming did youTheres actually a strong case for OMalley over Sanders and Clinton as a hypercompetent governor with solid liberal credentials and a record of accomplishment Thats not a case that OMalley was able to present Sunday night
