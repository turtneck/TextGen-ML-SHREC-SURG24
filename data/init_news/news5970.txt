Russian strategic missile troops reportedly launched an RS18 ballistic missile on Tuesday The launch may have been a test of the advanced hypersonic glider warhead which would be able to defeat US antimissile systemsAccording to previous reports this nuke is also going to be made STEALTH and impossible to be detected by any current radar systems and it will carry a payload capable of wiping off areas as big as France or USs Texas state with a single missileThe test was conducted at midday from a site near the town of Yasny Orenburg region in the southern Urals and the warhead reached the Kura test range in Kamchatka in Russias Far EastThe test was a success The warhead was delivered to Kura field the Defense Ministry reportedPopular defense blog MilitaryRussiaru says the launch was meant to test Russias hypersonic glider warhead currently known by its developer designation object 4202 or Aeroballistic Hypersonic WarheadA select few countries are currently developing the technology The US has the HTV2 a device developed by DARPA that has two partially successful tests under its belt The Chinese warhead using the same technology is called DFZF with Beijing first confirming a test in 2014 India is also studying hypersonic flight technology but unlike Russia the US and China it is reportedly not developing a strategic missile warheadA hypersonic glider vehicle HGV is different from a conventional ballistic missile warhead in that it travels most of the time in the stratosphere rather than in space It gives an HGVtipped missile greater range and may give antimissile systems a shorter window to respond to an attackMore importantly an HGV can maneuver during the approach to a target at high speed making interception significantly harder because it makes guiding an interceptor missile towards the attacking vehicle challenging and potentially impossible with current rocket technologyObject 4202 is reportedly meant to be used with Russias nextgen heavy strategic missile the RS28 Sarmat Military experts estimate that the new ICBM an image of which was first made public this week may carry up to three HGVs as payloadA previous possible test of object 4202 was reported in AprilSource
