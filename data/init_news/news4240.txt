Jonathan Bernstein and Reihan Salam have written two smart articles on the Democratic presidential primary  or lack thereof  that are best read in tandem Bernsteins article is meant to explain why it looks like Democrats dont have a bench even though they do and Salams article is meant to show whos sitting on itBernsteins argument is related to the invisible primary theory of presidential elections Hillary Clinton he says has earned the support of the bulk of Democratic party actors and gained the acquiescence of other Democrats who arent as enthusiastic about her The result is that the Democratic Partys perfectly viable other candidates either dropped out or never seriously considered the racePerhaps a slightly clearer way to put it is this in the invisible primary when the contest is as much a draft as it is a campaign Clinton is opposed by essentially every Democrat fit for the presidency If the partys powerbrokers didnt want to support Clinton and instead really wanted Sen Michael Bennet to run or Gov Andrew Cuomo to lead the field they would be working toward that outcome Instead theyre lining up behind Clinton In this telling Clinton isnt winning by default Shes winning by winning The absence of competition is the product of Clintons strong successful campaign to win over Democratic Party elitesHillarys strength is evident in public polling too Gallup has auseful favorabilityfamiliarity index the upshot of which is that Clinton is both better known than anyone else in the race and viewed more favorably than almost anyone else in the race Ben Carson is viewed very favorably too but as he becomes better known among Democrats my guess is that his negatives will rise quicklyThis is the context for Hillarys dominance on the Democratic side shes in a much stronger position not just than any Democrat going into 2016 but also than any Republican These are early polls and the numbers can and will change but look where Clinton is compared to Jeb Bush or Scott Walker Thats a big deal to Democrats and a big reason theyre supporting her rather than looking for an alternativeSalamoffers a wish list of Democratic presidential contenders His list excludes possible candidates like exMaryland Governor Martin OMalley or exVirginia Senator Jim Webb Rather it includes plausible candidates who seem to have no interest in becoming actual candidatesAny contest for the Democratic presidential nomination needs an earnest nerdy liberal technocrat who appeals to the intelligentsia writes Salam and he nominates Sen Ron Wyden a favorite of wonks and civil libertarians everywhereSalam goes on to push Sen Sherrod Brown as a liberal champion exMassachusetts Governor Deval Patrick for his ability to speak to the postFerguson moment in the postObama Democratic Party exNew York Mayor Michael Bloomberg as the grave centrist and Sen Amy Klobuchar as a Midwest problemsolverThe point isnt that any of these candidates will run The point is that they could run and they would be in theory at least as credible as a Scott Walker or a Jeb Bush They may not seem like presidential contenders now but as Bernstein writes the way those solid politicians become Serious Presidential Candidates and not just random governors and senators  Im talking here about folks such as Scott Walker Marco Rubio John Kasich and Bobby Jindal  is to start running and visibly enough so the press notices Which is all to say that Bernstein is right the Democratic Party has a bench Its just that Clinton is running so strongly in the invisible primary that no one on it thinks its worth getting in the gameThe question for the Democratic Party is whether Clinton is going to be as strong in the visible primary  and the visible election  as she is in the invisible one The skills necessary to win over Democratic Party elites may not be the skills necessary to win the election  and if Hillary doesnt face serious opposition in the visible primary Democrats may not find that out until too late
