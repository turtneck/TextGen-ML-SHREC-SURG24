On Wednesday after defeat in Indiana John Kasich is announcing he issuspending his campaignWhich raises the question WhyWhy now What changedIt was not as though he was ever winning Losing Indiana seemed like a classic Kasich move I thought his whole strategy was Win Ohio and then just sort of amble alongthe campaign trailuntil the convention at which point some kind of miracle will occurThat was even what his ads suggested Theybordered on the fantastical They were all missing several key stepsHe appeared to be running a full South Park Underpants Gnome strategy Phase One Collect Underpants Phase Two  Phase Three Profit with a big question mark hanging high in the sky until the conventionJohn Kasich is the nominee his PACsads ran because mumble mumble This I thought was the plan Somehow out of a clear blue skyeveryonewas supposed towakeup and realizewhat wasgoing on and do the right thingThis was already a science fiction premiseI thought oblivious was the strategy I thought this was the campaign equivalent of a filibuster where you just keep going until everyone around you is exhausted and succumbsWas he not doing this on purposeHe kept pointing out that he was good enough and smart enough and durn it people liked him especially in counterfactual scenarios The theme of the Kasich campaign wasthe sound of one hand hypothetically clapping Not to be confused with theJebcampaign the sound of one hand forgetting to clapHe was a particular favorite of hypothetical voters in a hypothetical general Unfortunatelythese days hypothetical voters are not enoughStill I thought that he was supposed to continue along on the Road Runner principle where if you never look down you never notice that you arerunning basically unsupported and can coast on to victory You dont need supporters as long as people basically dont mind that you are sticking aroundAs Donald Trump kept pointing out the percentage of states Kasich won got smaller and smaller with each new state added to the total What was keeping him in the raceThe dream of a contested convention Look the odds that if Trump failed to get 1237 delegates those who madeit to the floor wouldwind up choosing Kasich wereonly marginally better than the odds that Trump reached 1237 delegates and they miraculously picked Kasich anyhow Some miracle occurs was always an integral part of the Kasich strategy Why not stay just in caseWhen you are the last thing standing between the GOP and Trump is not the time to suddenly remember how this is supposed to work
