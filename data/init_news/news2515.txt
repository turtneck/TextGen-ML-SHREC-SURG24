The culture wars are always percolating beneath the surface in presidential politics  until something or someone pushes them to the surfaceThat something early in this cycle is Indianas Religious Freedom Restoration Act which Republican Gov Mike Pence who is considering a run for president in 2016 signed into law last week It has caused a firestorm of criticism from those who say the law could lead to discrimination against gays and lesbians including businesses like Apple and Angies List the NCAA which is hosting the mens college basketball Final Four in Indianapolis and even other states like Connecticut which banned statepaid travel to IndianaPence seemed surprised by the backlash and has had some difficulty explaining his position Other potential 2016 candidates have leapt to his defense and some like Florida Sen Marco Rubio went further than the Indiana governorSupporters say Indianas law is similar to the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act passed in 1993As is often the case in controversies however the facts have become muddled and conflated So what are the facts How are the two laws different And how have politics on both sides shaped the responseSeeking Clarification And A Fix As The Contenders Weigh InOn Tuesday Pence said there has been misunderstanding and confusion and mischaracterization of this law But he said he is seeking clarification and a fix to the law with legislation that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyoneOn Monday though the law became part of the presidential campaign with Republican presidential candidates weighing in after a Sunday show performance from Pence that raised more questions Pence sidestepped half a dozen specific questions about whether the law could lead to discrimination against gays and lesbiansFormer Florida Gov Jeb Bush contended that facts had not been established and once they are people arent going to see this as discriminatory at allWisconsin Gov Scott Walker backed the law and said through a spokesman that it was about the right for Americans to exercise their religion and act on their conscienceTexas Sen Ted Cruz said the law is giving voice to millions of courageous conservativesRubio though did something the other candidates did not He more directly addressed the charge that businesses could discriminate against gay and lesbian couples Gayrights advocates for example say if a gay or lesbian couple wanted a flower arrangement or cake for a reception a florist or caterer could lawfully choose not to fill the order if he has a religious objectionRubio said he thinks businesses should have that rightThe issue were talking about here is should someone who provides a professional service be punished by the law because they refused to provide that professional service to a ceremony that they believe is in violation of their faith he said on Fox News Monday I think people have a right to live out their religious faith in their own livesMost conservatives including Pence have mostly not addressed that charge headon Instead they say the law is unfairly maligned After all other states have similar laws and even Democrat Bill Clinton signed a federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law as presidentHillary Clinton for the record tweeted Sad this new Indiana law can happen in America today We shouldnt discriminate against ppl bc of who they loveThe White House on Tuesday blasted Pence and others who falsely suggest the two laws  Indianas and the federal one  are the sameThat is not true White House press secretary Josh Earnest said at the White House daily briefing He cited the spirit of the law as well as the text He said the 1993 law was an effort to protect the religious liberty of religious minorities based on actions that could be taken by the federal governmentOn the other hand The Indiana law is much broader Earnest continued It doesnt just apply to individuals or religious minorities It applies to and Im quoting here a partnership a limited liability company a corporation a company a firm a society a joint stock company or an unincorporated association So this obviously is a significant expansion of the law in terms of the way that it would apply  This is a much more openended piece of legislation that could reasonably be used to try to justify discriminating against somebody because of who they loveFirst lets start with how and why the 1993 law came to be The federal law stemmed from an Oregon Native American man who lost his job in 1990 after testing positive for drugs He had used peyote as part of a religious ritual The fix to that problem became the federal RFRA introduced by soontobe Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer then a House member from New York A companion bill passed the Senate and was introduced by the late Sen Ted KennedyNineteen states in addition to Indiana have since enacted their own RFRAs but as The Atlantic notes just South Carolina and Texas have similar variations to Indianas and neither seems to go quite as farIndiana Vs Federal Law  What Do They SayThe Federal RFRA states that Government shall not substantially burden a persons exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability The Indiana law also states A governmental entity may not substantially burden a persons exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicabilityThat is the federal law states except when it is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interestIndiana also states the exception as 1 is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest and 2 is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interestBut thats where the similarities endThe federal law does not go so far as to define a person Indianas law does And a person by its standard is not what you might thinkSection 7 of the Indiana code includes people churches and corporations in that definitionAs related to whether why or who can sue the federal law saysThe Indiana law goes further In Section 9 it states that a person in this case meaning an individual church limited liability company etc whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened or is likely to be substantially burdened by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceedingSo in other words while the federal law states that a person can sue the government for a grievance Indiana makes a point of stating that it doesnt matter if government is involvedJosh Blackman a constitutional law professor at South Texas College notes in National Review that while some read the federal provision as pertaining only to government it has actually split federal courts Private parties he points out had brought suits against corporationsFor example The DC Circuit held that the Catholic University of America could raise RFRA as a defense against a sexdiscrimination claim brought by a nun and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alikeThat said the Indiana law explicitly wipes away any ambiguitySupport for gay rights has increased dramatically over the past decade Since former President George W Bush proposed a ban on samesex marriage during his 2004 presidential reelection campaign support for samesex marriage has reversedIn 2004 a majority of the country  55 percent  was against it while 42 percent was in favor according to Gallup Now its exactly the opposite with 55 percent saying theyre in favor of samesex marriage and 42 percent saying theyre against itWhats more in 2004 54 percent said gay or lesbian relations were morally wrong In 2014 58 percent said it was morally acceptable while just 38 percent said it was wrong That is a huge cultural and political shift in a relatively short timeIts something Republican pollster Whit Ayres likens to approval of interracial marriage in the 1970s to 1990s In his book 2016 and Beyond How Republicans Can Elect a President in the New America he points out citing Gallup numbers that in 1972 some 60 percent of Americans disapproved of interracial marriage Twentyfive years later 64 percent approved with the lines crossing when the country split about evenly in 1983It looks similar to gay marriage Ayres told reporters at a breakfast meeting Tuesday sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor The values of young people I believe this is where we are headed as a country He added We are headed to where a political candidate who is perceived as antigay will never connect with people under 30 years oldBut going inside the numbers helps explain why both sides are singing very different tunes on the Indiana law For example Gallup found that 3 in 4 Democrats are in favor of samesex marriage as were almost 60 percent of independents but the opposite was true for Republicans with 72 percent opposed as of 2013That makes it difficult to get through a Republican primary being too strongly in favor of gay rights with a significant portion of the base considering themselves social values religious votersThats a challenge said Ayres who is advising RubioHe points out that Republicans under 30 support samesex marriage A Pew poll in 2014 in fact found 61 percent of young Republicans in favorSo while times are changing with Republicans on gay rights they are doing so more slowly than the more rapid change taking place in the country at large
