textile artisans She also writes regularly about legal political economy and regulatory topics for various consulting clients and publications as well as writes occasional travel pieces for The National  The biggest story on Indian television yesterday wasnt the election of Donald Trump For on Tuesday night IST Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a surprise speech declared that currency notes of rupees Rs 500 and Rs 1000  the highest two denominations in circulation would be invalid as of midnight that same night The withdrawn notes could no longer be used for transacting business or as a store of value for future usage with some limited exceptions but even these were only allowed for a short transition period From Modis speech  There is a need for a decisive war against the menace of corruption black money and terrorism Corruption black money and terrorism are festering wounds which make the country hollow from within he said adding such activities hold back the nations progress Describing illegal financial activities as the biggest blot Modi said that despite several steps taken by his government over the last twoandahalf years Indias global ranking on corruption had moved only to 76th position from 100th earlier This shows the extent of the web of corruption in the country The disease of corruption is the domain of some veted people who are flourishing Some people have misused their positions and benefitted On the other hand honest people are suffering he said The Reserve Bank of India RBI the Indian central bank as reported by The Times of India  elaborated The incidence of fake Indian currency notes in higher denomination has increased For ordinary persons the fake notes look similar to genuine notes even though no security feature has been copied The fake notes are used for antinational and illegal activities High denomination notes have been misused by terrorists and for hoarding black money India remains a cash based economy hence the circulation of Fake Indian Currency Notes continues to be a menace In order to contain the rising incidence of fake notes and black money the scheme to withdraw has been introduced Chaos Ensues India remains a cashbased economy especially for lowvalue transactions and the move has caused widespread chaos as I write this from Kolkata where I am currently visiting The move was accompanied by a temporary shut down of all banks and ATMs with banks reopening earlier today and ATMs due to reopen tomorrow Initially after the announcement the highest denomination legal tender note in circulation was the Rs 100 note New legally tender Rs 500 and Rs 2000 notes have been made available today according to Tushar Roy chief manager of a nationalized bank Central Bank of India Not all banks have yet received the new notes but Roy says that this problem is expected to be resolved soon The government also expects to reintroduce Rs 1000 notes soon to include advanced security features When ATMs open tomorrow withdrawals will be limited to a maximum of Rs 2000 per transaction as compared to the Rs 10000 and in some cases Rs 15000 limits that previously applied Starting today after producing appropriate identification people are allowed to exchange old notes for new at any of the 19 RBI offices any bank branch or at any head post office or subpost office They will have until December 30 to complete their transactions Individuals receive full value for the entire volume of bank notes tendered at any of these venues but heres the kicker At the moment each person is limited to receiving only Rs 4000 per person in cash irrespective of the size of tender Anything over and above that amount can only be credited to a bank account This allows the government to track whether the sums tendered have been legitimately acquired Withdrawals from bank accounts will be limited to Rs 10000 a day and Rs 20000 a week The government has announced this part of the policy may be relaxed in future says Roy in order for employers for example to meet payrolls currently made in cash Ultimately the government wants more transactions to be paid via bank accounts so that they can be tracked and taxed appropriately Does The Policy Make Sense Its beyond the scope of this post to speculate on the impact the new policy will have on individuals of various occupations and with myriad reasons for transacting in large amounts of cash For more on this point interested readers might wish to look at this article in The Wire  Some have criticized the policy for focusing on currency alone and have noted that black money is typically not held by Indians in stacks of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes but in one of two alternative ways The very rich store black assets in offshore accounts as detailed in among other sources the Panama Papers But tax evasion and corruption is not limited to the very richest alone In India many doctors and other professionals members of the business community and small traders also underreport their taxable income They tend to hold their black assets onshore within India in the form of real estate art work gold bullion jewellery or securities Unlike other current policy areas border incursions into Pakistan for example the political opposition has has not contested the objective of the Modi move There is virtually unanimous concurrence at least publicly on cracking down on black money Yet as The Hindu reported former Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram has criticized the Modi governments method for achieving its objective We support the objective of the government to stamp out black money But the method they have adopted raises questions The move has come as a bolt from the blue for the common man The real test for the government would begin Thursday Mr Chidambaram said How efficiently and how quickly the money is exchanged If there is harassment or inconvenience and all kinds of questions are asked then I think that will be completely counterproductive A similar move had been contemplated by the previous Congressled UPA government he recalled But the idea was dropped as the economic gains were not too great Mr Chidambaram said the introduction of the new series of notes was estimated to cost Rs 15000 crores to Rs 20000 crores JerriLynn here a crore is 10000000 in the Indian numbering system The economic gains of demonetisation should be at least equal to that amount If the additional tax revenue pulled in by the Modi move is less than that amount the new policy will actually have ended up costing the government money rather than increasing government revenues As Chidambaram summarized again from The Hindu article quoted above The economic wisdom of the governments decision Mr Chidambaram said would be tested on three parameters a the present cash to GDP ratio is 12 per cent Will it come down to the world average of about 4 per cent b The value of the high denomination notes currently in circulation is about 15 lakh crore rupees JerriLynn here a lakh is 100000 a crore 10000000 so a lakh crore is 1000000000000 Will that value come down significantly c Will gold imports surge indicating that unaccounted income wealth is seeking refuge in bullion and gold jewellery Various economists have also presented other criticisms of the governments move as reported by The Wire Requiring a switch to new bank notes means Indians must take time to switch their existing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes into the new bank notes If new notes are not freely and widely available this will freeze trade and the normal functioning of an exchange economy Further many Indians receive salaries in cash and do not have bank accounts at present so requiring transactions to pass through the banking system will cause them considerable immediate inconvenience Impact on Economic Activity But there is a wider reason for critiquing the policy Black money and not paying taxes These are bad things in a society says Suvojit Bagchi Kolkata bureau chief for The Hindu Not surprisingly everyone including the opposition agrees on the objective of cracking down on black money Increasing the tax base is the prime objective here But will the demonetization policy produce substantial tax revenue Bagchi noted that Chidambaram questioned whether taxes raised would be sufficient to recoup the cost of printing new bank notes Another objective Bagchi added is to move India away from its reliance on cash toward a more American or European plastic system where its easier to track and tax money And finally at least half of Indian economic activity occurs in the informal sector which is not tightly controlled Bagchi gave the example of a building promoter whose building activity produces both black and white revenues Indeed perhaps 40 of the promoters overall activity he estimated might be black activity But that black activity also generates employment as well as other knock on effects While the government hopes that its policy will increase the tax base its also possible that demonetization might instead lead to the shut down of at least some black activity So the governments latest move may actually slow economic activity considerably Bagchi says But for how long and to what extent no one knows He further added At the moment the Indian economy is somewhat insulated from the world economy in part due to its reliance on cash and the existence of considerable black activity Once India moves to a plastic system and cuts back on that black activity it will lose some of this insulation As reported in The Wire  Abhijit Sen former member of the Planning Commission is also concerned about contraction in the informal sector The sudden decision to demonetise currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000 is targeted to reduce illicit stocks of black money and fake currency This has a clear rationale if such notes are used mainly to stock undisclosed wealth rather than for transactions However RBI data show that currency notes of these two denominations make up over 80 of the total currency in circulation Therefore unless a very large proportion of money in circulation lies permanently as stocks the demonetisation can also be expected to have a significant immediate effect on that part of the economy which relies mainly on cash transactions The size of Indias cash economy is not exactly known but given the large proportion of workers in informal sectors it is unlikely to be less than half the total economy We can therefore expect an immediate contraction of this part of the economy in the next two days and with the effect stretching over a longer period of time although diminishing over time Whatever its longterm positive effects those depending on cash whether for daily wages or as payments for goods or services they sell are likely to be in for tough times in the coming days In the long term as well all that this does is partially eliminate some black money stocks without undoing the processes that lead to black money creation
