Dan Kahan and his team at the Yale Law Schools Cultural Cognition project have been doing a bunch of research recently onThats of obvious interest to Monkey Cage readers and students of politics more generallyTo what extent are our attitudes on hotbutton issues simple products of our political leaningsThe question is important because political decisions are in part driven by public opinion The answer cant be simple We know that the correlations between issue attitudes partisanship and ideology have changed over time For example conservatives are more likely than liberals and moderates to believe that vaccines cause autismOur beliefs about science and ideology are themselves often rigid Onetrick that Kahan uses to shake us up is what he calls the MAPKIA Make a prediction know it all challenge in which he describes an experiment on public opinion but without revealing the results and then asks the reader to guess what will happenFor his latest MAPKIA challenge Kahan brings up a question from a 2015 Pew Research survey on Public and Scientists Views on Science and Society Heres the survey itemHow powerfully if at all will responses to the Pew Malthusian Worldview item predict beliefs and attitudes toward technological and environmental risks like climate change fracking nuclear power and GM foods Will it be a stronger predictor than political partisanship Will responses interact with  or essentially amplify  the explanatory power of political ideology and party identification What will the relationship be between the Malthusian Worldview item and science literacy Will responses be correlated with it  and if so in which direction Will higher science literacy magnify the correlation between responses to the Malthusian Worldview and opposing perceptions of environmental and technological risks just as higher science comprehension magnifies cultural polarization on climate change nuclear power fracking and the likeIf youre interested in political polarization and attitudes toward science and policy this is a great question And as Kahan writes Perhaps my framing of the question implies an answer But if you think I have one then obviously mine could be wrongAs sociologist Duncan Watts has written everything is obvious once you know the answer Thats why its a good exercise to commit first on this one before learning the answerHeres an example from the Monkey Cage a couple of years ago of researchers who jumped to conclusion about public opinion which turned out not to be borne out by the data As I wrote at the timeAlfred Moore Joseph Parent and Joseph Uscinski write When science means nuclear weapons innovation and winning the space race conservatives love it Actually when I last looked at the data I found that support for the space program does not seem particularly associated with conservative or Republican positions There is indeed a logic to the idea that conservatives should support the space program see my last paragraph here but the data dont seem to bear this out My quick understanding of this is that political ideologies are interesting but ultimately you cant make sense of them any given persons views are a tangle with many possibilitiesTo return to the Malthusian worldview challenge My point here is that political ideology and issue attitudes are tangled Attitudes are not always carefully thought through nor are they the pure product of political ideology or partisanshipThe Malthusian worldview seems like it might be a proxy for a simple liberalconservative dimension at least in the United States but maybe it aligns with other aspects of peoples worldviews In this post Im purposely not giving the answer or to be precise Im not giving data that would address this question but am rather following Kahan by leaving it unresolved to remind us of the uncertainty we should hold before seeing hard data on the relevant public opinion questions
