In a political season marked by nonstop polling a lively exchange took place recently about the state of public opinion research and what to believe about all of the numbers describing the state of the raceThe context for the discussion was set by a series of national and state surveys showing Donald Trump gaining on or overtaking Hillary Clinton in the generalelection campaign It broadened into an examination how polls are produced and used in a competitive media environmentEarlier this spring Clinton enjoyed a substantial lead over Trump Now the RealClearPolitics poll average in the presidential race shows Clinton with a lead of just one point 438 to 428 percent Some recent polls showed Trump ahead including a Washington PostABC News poll of registered voters released a week agoThe shift raised questions Is this merely a bounce for Trump because he has wrapped up the Republican nomination while Clinton is still fighting a campaign against Bernie Sanders In that case will Clinton reverse Trumps gains once she has claimed the Democratic nomination Do the current polls mean that the general election will be close and hardfought Most provocatively is there something wrong with some of these pollsThe first salvo in the exchange came from Norman J Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute and Alan I Abramowitz a political scientist at Emory University Both are scholars to whom Ive gone many times as Ive reported campaigns and politics generally The two coauthored an oped for the New York Times titled Stop the Polling InsanityThey pointed to what they said were wild fluctuations and surprising results in recent TrumpClinton polls They also underscored how news organizations are producing polls at a rapid rate and using them to make news and generate clicks Too many of this years polls and their coverage have been cringeworthy they wroteOrnstein and Abramowitz took issue with a ReutersIpsos tracking poll that showed Clinton with a 13point lead on May4 a tie five days later and then a sixpoint lead for Clinton on May 15 They questioned whether opinions could have shifted that much during a time when there were no major events in the campaignThey challenged an online NBCSurveyMonkey poll that showed Trump within three points of Clinton and said that Trump was receiving 28percent of the Hispanic vote when most other surveys have shown Mr Trump eking out 10 to 12 percent among Latino votersThey also raised doubts about a trio of Quinnipiac polls in the battleground states of Florida Ohio and Pennsylvania arguing that the samples used in the surveys were whiter than the states had in 2012 exit pollsWhen polling aficionados see results that seem surprising or unusual the first instinct is to look under the hood at things like demographic and partisan distributions they wrote When cable news hosts and talking heads see these kinds of results they exult report and analyze ad nauseam Caveats or cautions are rarely includedThe two scholars went on to cite wellknown challenges for all types of polls Traditional polls considered the most reliable over a long period of time use random samples of the population call landlines and cellphones and use real people to conduct the interviews But those surveys are extremely costly and response rates for many have plummeted over the yearsOnline surveys use panels of potential respondents rather than randomly drawn samples The methodology differs among the practitioners and is in a regular state of examination and refinement They are much less expensive to produceOrnstein and Abramowitzs oped prompted a rejoinder from Jon Cohen SurveyMonkeys chief research officer and Mark Blumenthal the firms head of election polling For the record Cohen is a former polling director at The Post and someone with whom Ive worked closely and collaboratively over many yearsThe SurveyMonkey duo took issue with the suggestion that polls showing Trump and Clinton in a close race are almost by definition to be questioned Its not enough for Trumps opponents to wish him away they wrote Its important for political professionals to actually explore what is buoying Trump  even if they find his rise unfathomableThey argued that the polls have not been on a wild ride In fact they said there was a clear trend based on the moving average of an average of all polls Once Trump became the presumptive GOP nominee after his victory in the May 3 Indiana primary Clintons lead began to shrinkAs for the NBCSurveyMonkey poll showing Trump winning 28percent of the Hispanic vote they noted that six other national surveys taken after the reality TV star effectively secured the nomination showed his Hispanic support ranging from 15percent to 31percent while acknowledging they were on the high end But they said Clintons margin over Trump among Hispanics across the six polls ranged from 23points to 53points The NBCSurveyMonkey polls margin was in the middle of that range at 37 pointsCiting the late Andrew Kohut the founder of Pew Research they said those in the field of survey research should be measurers not handicappers Now more than ever at this moment of reinvention for public opinion polling we need many independent estimates of voter preferences not a herd of handicappers issuing their best guesses about the eventual outcome they wroteThose exchanges prompted another voice to enter the conversation that of Mark Mellman a respected Democratic pollster to whom many journalists long have gone for his insights into polls and elections Noting that Ornstein Abramowitz Cohen and Blumenthal were all very smart people Mellman sought to avoid taking sides and instead offered a few thoughts of his own on the issues raisedWriting in the Hill Mellman began by saying that an examination of polling averages of RealClearPolitics and the Huffington Posts Pollsters model showed that there is little doubt that the presidential race has tightened considerably since March and April But he added that the current state of the race does not necessarily mean the outcome in November will be closeHe reminded everyone that in the spring of 2008 when John McCain had wrapped up the Republican nomination while Barack Obama was still engaged in a hard contest against Clinton the generalelection polls showed the Arizona senator ahead He lost the general election by 7percentage pointsLooking at the issue of Trumps support among Hispanics in the NBCSurveyMonkey poll he said that 28percent seems high but not bizarrely out of sync given other polls and history He also said that if Trump were getting say 13percent of the Hispanic vote rather than 28percent Trumps overall number in the horse race would be just 15points lowerPolls have played a significant role in this campaign Theyve determined participation in the GOP debates and how the candidates were aligned on the stage and theyve driven a lot of coverage of the race There is no question that news organizations have sometimes been indiscriminate in the way they have highlighted individual pollsSo there is food for thought in this series of exchanges The traditional method of polling has become prohibitively expensive for most organizations at a time when the demand for public opinion surveys continues to grow in politics and other fields The methodology of all types of polls is under challenge There is a serious and urgent debate underway among public opinion researchers about the way forwardFor the rest of us the exchanges lead to common points of agreement all of which might seem obvious but should not be forgotten Dont put too much emphasis on any single poll Look closely at averages of groups of polls to determine whether there are real shifts in the race And dont expect polls to predict the future Leave that question to the voters in November
