Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are in a pitched battle for the Democratic nomination fighting for the hearts and minds of leftleaning voters across the USBut where do they stand on the issues While the candidates often agree on substance if not style heres a look at five areas where they differ  not just from each other but from their presidential predecessors as wellThey will go up  but for whomBernie Sanders promises he will reduce income inequality through changes to US through tax policy He has called for a 10 tax surcharge on billionaires raising the top three tax brackets and creating a new top rate boosting capital gains and estate taxes extending Social Security taxes going after income made abroad by US corporations and creating a new 02 tax on all earners to fund a paid family leave programmeHillary Clintons tax plan is basically Sanderslite She wants a 4 surtax on income over 5 million an increase in capital gains taxes the closing of tax loopholes for the wealthy taxing hedge fund managers carried interest income at higher rates and increasing the estate tax rateBill Clinton also raised taxes on the wealthy  and caught considerable criticism from conservatives for doing so He instituted two new highlevel tax brackets raised corporate taxes and increased income subject to Medicare and Social Security levies After Republicans took control of Congress two years into his administration he signed legislation lowering the capital gains taxes He also increased a tax credit for poorer workersJohn F Kennedy was the original Democratic taxcutter He reduced the top rate in the US from 95 to 65 and the corporate tax rate from 52 to 47 Todays conservatives love to quote his claim that a high tax rate siphons out of the private economy too large a share of personal and business purchasing powerPitching college education thats free or just affordableBernie Sanders has set the bar when it comes to higher education policy in the modern Democratic Party with his call for free college for all Americans funded by taxing Wall Street financial transactions He points to the runaway costs of higher education as one of the driving forces behind growing income inequality in the USHillary Clinton supports a plan to make twoyear community college free but her higher education policies are more modest She has called for lowering student loan interest rates providing 175 billion to improve the quality of higher education and encouraging colleges to set affordable tuition rates that dont require student loansBarack Obama signed legislation streamlining the student loan system including provisions that allow the government to directly loan money to students rather than rely on forprofit middlemen He has also proposed making the first two years of college free with a programme modelled on a Tennessee system devised by the states Republican governorLyndon Baines Johnson is the godfather of the modern Democratic Partys education policies As president he spearheaded passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965 which increased federal funding for universities and provided lowinterest student loans and grants for needy students It was landmark legislation in its day  but now seems relatively modestMend it or end it  and start over from scratchBarack Obama supported and signed legislation increasing government regulation of the health insurance industry and creating private insurance markets for individuals not covered by employerprovided insurance The programme was based in part on Republican proposals from the 1990s and the system instituted in Massachusetts by thenGovernor Mitt RomneyFor Bernie Sanders however that particular halfloaf is far from enough He wants to institute a singlepayer governmentrun health insurance system fashioned on Medicare He has also called for allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies in order to lower prices and permitting Americans to import medication from Canada where it is less expensiveHillary Clinton has said Mr Sanders is advancing an unrealistic proposal that threatens hardwon healthcare reforms made during Mr Obamas tenure Instead she wants to expand existing law to improve coverage for prescription drugs and allow the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers for better pricesThe former first lady does know a thing or two about how hard it is to get healthcare bills through Congress In 1993 she was the driving force behind Bill Clintons proposed legislation which created a federal minimumbenefits healthcare package with limits on outofpocket expenses all provided by regional healthcare alliances That effort went down in flames before it even came to a vote in CongressThe one place where Clinton comes at Sanders from the leftHillary Clinton is the first prominent Democratic presidential candidate to openly run on a guncontrol platform since Al Gores losing campaign in 2000 She supports holding gun manufacturers liable for deaths caused by their products expanding background checks and prohibiting those on nofly list from purchasing firearms She has also supported reinstating the ban on semiautomatic assault riflesBernie Sanders a senator from the rural state of Vermont has a more moderate position on guns  although he has moved to the left over the course of the campaign He supports expanded background checks on gun purchases and an assault weapons ban but opposes holding gun manufacturers liable for deaths He voted against a gun purchase waiting period multiple times in the early 1990s and for allowing guns in national parksBarack Obama shied away from campaigning on gun control in his two presidential campaigns but the murder of schoolchildren in Newtown Connecticut in December 2012 convinced him to act He has since called for an assault weapons ban and expanded background checks He has taken unilateral executive action to increase enforcement of laws against gun trafficking and broadening the scope of federal regulation of firearm transactionsFranklin Delano Roosevelt made the first serious effort at gun control by a Democratic president to date and his call in 1934 to create a national firearm registry and institute a federal tax on all gun purchases No major Democratic officeholder would even consider broaching such a proposal today It wouldnt just be dead on arrival in Congress for many politicians it would be political suicideHillary Clinton as secretary of state was one of the more hawkish members of Mr Obamas cabinet Its no surprise then that as a presidential candidate she is well to the right of Mr Sanders and even Mr Obama She has called for greater US involvement in the Syrian civil war including enforcing a nofly zone and supports a continued US military presence in AfghanistanBernie Sanders generally agrees with Barack Obamas foreign policies  limited involvement in Syria and an emphasis on working with US allies He contrasts himself with Mrs Clinton by noting the past US military action that she supported and he opposed  in Libya and Iraq He supports a full US withdrawal from Afghanistan and no US training of rebels in the Syrian civil warJohn F Kennedys foreign policy as president compared to the current crop of Democratic politicians seems downright bellicose He was an interventionist at heart authorising the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba taking a hard line against Soviet expansion in the Western hemisphere and initiating US involvement in Vietnam
