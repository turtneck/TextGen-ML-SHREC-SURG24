The decision by Pope Francis to give his personal blessing  and a rosary  to Rowan County clerk Kim Davis thrust the pontiff into one of Americas most volatile cultural battlesIn his meeting with controversial county clerk Kim Davis last Thursday Pope Francis reportedly told Ms Davis to stand strong as she stands up for her religious beliefs in rural KentuckyThe meeting between the pontiff and a woman who went to jail for five days for defying a Supreme Court order to allow samesex couples to marry came before Francis made comments about conscientious objection as a human right even for government officialsIn some ways the meeting fit with the popes focus on the spirit of encounter as well as his unorthodox meetings with people he calls on the peripheries And it also came days after he met with nuns fighting an Obamacare mandate on contraceptives another front in the American cultural warsBut the 15minute ttette at the Vatican Embassy in Washington also jarred a number of narratives from the popes historic visit suggesting to some critics that the pontiff condoned Davis actions  which critics say amount to imposing her personal religious beliefs in violation of the Constitution on samesex couples seeking marriage licensesThe decision by the pope to give his personal blessing  and a rosary  to Davis thrust the pontiff into one of Americas most volatile cultural battlesIn other ways however Francis focused Romes gaze on the changing dynamics of religious freedom in the progressive era offering a moment of pause for many Americans to consider growing questions about how the United States handles religious objections to samesex unionsI think both sides have either tried to vilify or champion Kim Davis in one way or another but what theyre forgetting is that the central issue here is of religious freedom in the US and how we treat it What does it mean and what are its boundaries says Joe Valenzano an expert on religious rhetoric at the University of Dayton in Ohio The fact is both sides have made just a colossal mess out of this to further their own perspective rather than focusing on what could be a productive conversation for societyThe Vatican confirmed the meeting but gave no further commentary potentially suggesting that it didnt want to get into the political details of the struggle over samesex marriage in Rowan County Ky For some Vatican observers it wasnt surprising that the pope a religious figure met with someone who has become a lightning rod for her religious beliefsThe pope took somebody on the front of the newspapers for faithrelated concerns and met with her says Professor Valenzano The pope told Davis that you dont lose faith because you lose a battle Thats not the pope weighing in on the culture wars or endorsing Kim Daviss position Thats the pope endorsing the idea that religion is important to peopleYet for all the popes focus on moral values the meeting with Davis and the nuns could have a political impact writes John Allen Jr on Crux a Catholic news site For one he writes the meeting means that Francis has significantly strengthened the hand of the US bishops and other voices in American debates defending religious freedomThe meeting also could give more direct encouragement to other US officials who have declined to offer marriage licenses to samesex couples A number of clerks and other government officials have followed Daviss lead refusing to abide by the Supreme Courts June ruling declaring samesex marriage a constitutional rightThe problem with that strategy however is that Davis for one represents what Doug Laycock calls a poor example of a religious martyr He points out that Davis didnt just want an optout from signing marriage licenses for samesex couples Instead after her release from jail she changed the Rowan County license form to take the name of the county off the form  a change the plaintiffs argue violates the judges orderKim Davis gives religious liberty a bad name and endangers it for everybody says Professor Laycock a religious liberty expert at the University of Virginia Law School in Charlottesville She does not have to issue marriage licenses But the county is not entitled to exemption because the county does not have a religion Thats the fundamental distinctionThose nuances may have been lost on the pope Mr Laycock suggestsIf you come here from Rome if youre not closely following this you dont have any sort of deep understanding of US law he saysThe pontiff made waves in the US during his visit for his attempt to expand the Catholic churchs influence beyond the culture wars He weighed in on climate change and the death penalty bolstering his bona fides among US liberals But he also buckled down on church doctrine on abortion and threats to the sanctity of marriage to the applause of conservativesI cant have in mind all the cases that can exist about conscientious objection the pope said on the papal plane last week but yes I can say that conscientious objection is a right that is a part of every human right It is a rightAnd if a person does not allow others to be a conscientious objector he denies a right he said adding in what may have been a reference to Davis It is a human right and if a government official is a human person he has that rightFor American political operatives the popes message may ultimately be frustrating for its nuance And that may be just fine with the pontiff As Elizabeth Buerlin writes in the New Republic Pope Francis maintains a conservative position on the morality of marriage and he is concerned for Christians who find their practice constrained by law But he has also emphasized openness toward LGBT Catholics famously asking when queried about gay Catholics Who am I to judge In that way she writes Francis has at least until now shied away from directly engaging the psychodrama of the American culture warsBut by meeting with Davis privately the pope at the very least showed a willingness to take a stand on religious liberty even if it tarnished his message in the eyes of some AmericansThe news that Pope Francis met privately  with Kim Davis throws a wet blanket on the good will that the pontiff had garnered during his US visitFrancis DeBernardo executive director of gay and lesbian Catholic advocacy group New Ways Ministry told Reuters in an emailAt the same time some Americans said the visit may have helped humanize a polarizing figure in the struggle between deeplyfelt religious beliefs and the equally deep desire by many gay Americans to marryAny time you get people talking and meeting and listening even if they dont agree as long as there is a dialogue I think we are better as a nation Judy Fitzpatrick a Catholic who describes herself as moderate Republican told a new IpsosReuters poll after hearing about Francis meeting Davis
