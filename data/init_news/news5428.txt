The Texas senator has suffered through a string of rough news cycles from losing evangelicals to Donald Trump in South Carolina to firing his communications director and finishing behind Marco Rubio in NevadaGet more mustread campaign news and analysis delivered directly to your email inbox with The Daily 202But Cruz finally caught a few big breaks last night and he could now emerge once again as the best bet to stop Trump He won his home state of Texas by 17 points the days biggest delegate prize the neighboring state of Oklahoma in a surprise and the caucuses in Alaska underscoring his appeal to libertarians and in spite of Sarah Palins support for Trump He lost Arkansas to Trump by just 2 points Rubio meanwhile had a very disappointing night and continues to not live up to his potential He won only the Minnesota caucuses and wound up losing Virginia which was fertile territory and where he campaigned hardBesides the obvious reality check that the Florida senator has won just one of the first 15 states thats a 114 record in football terms he finished third yesterday behind Cruz in several states where he ought to have finished second including Tennessee where he had the backing of Gov Bill Haslam and Sen Lamar Alexander and Massachusetts Top Rubio campaign officials told donors before results came in yesterday that they might win outright in Arkansas and Oklahoma He finished third in both of those places tooDespite campaigning hard in Alabama over the weekend Rubio only pulled in 187 percent And he got a point less than that in Texas where he campaigned and his team expected to do better This means he fell beneath the 20 percent threshold to collect any delegates from those states And it bears noting that in several states Democrats voted for Rubio to try embarrassing Trump Cruz today has far more delegates than Rubio and he doesnt have Gang of Eight baggage He has wellfunded super PACs Hes invested in building organizations for the upcoming caucus states and to collect delegates from places like Guam and the Virgin Islands To be clear On the day with the most delegates at stake Trump won seven of 11 states He romped in the Deep South while proving again that hes not a regional candidate His strongest performance actually came in Massachusetts where he took 49 percent of the voteThe Posts Dan Balz declares that the window for stopping Trump has now closed almost completelyHe explains that the demoralized antiTrump forces are very unlikely to agree upon a strategy to stop the New York billionaire Theres this fallacy that some small group can get together and decide the outcome of this former Utah Gov Mike Leavitt told him That does not existThat stipulated Balz argues Cruz can now claim with more credibility the mantle of the true conservative in a conservative party against a frontrunner with no clear ideology and views at odds with GOP orthodoxy Whether thats enough to win in Northern states is an open questionThe Fixs Chris Cillizza also declares Cruz a winner and Rubio a loser of the night Suddenly Cruz looks like the favorite to be the alternative to Trump Plus the votes between Tuesday and the March 15 primaries  Louisiana Kansas etc  look like potential Cruz winsThe establishment loathes Cruz but they may reconsider if faced with a binary choice between Trump and Cruz Cruz is not my favorite by any means  but we may be in a position where we have to rally around Cruz as the only way to stop Trump Im not so sure that would work Sen Lindsey Graham RSC said on CBS Asked if he would recommend rallying behind Cruz to stop Trump Graham said yes I cant believe I would say yes but yes he said By all accounts the GOP field will stay scattered which works to Trumps advantageKasich came within three points of winning Vermont We have absolutely exceeded expectations he said promising to fight on in Michigan and OhioRubio in Miami claimed a late surge and predicted hell win Florida on March 15 His home state is winner take all If he loses there hes done Polls show him trailing and its not a sure thing he can pull it outBen Carson said hes not ready to quit quite yet which means hell continue to dilute the antiTrump evangelical voteAs Cruz himself correctly pointed out during his speech in Houston So long as the field remains divided Donald Trumps path to the nomination remains more likely As of today the Republican National Convention in Cleveland seems like theonly place Trump can still be stopped Importantly though Cruzs success is showing palpable signs of galvanizing not just his supporters some of whom were thinking about jumping ship if he had a bad night but other movement conservativesDavid Bossie the president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United told David Weigel that it is now time for Rubio to end his campaign and let Cruz take Trump onErick Erickson formerly of RedState now at The Resurgent It is time for Rubio behind by double digits in his home state  to accept he will not be the nominee It is time for Cruz to accept we need a unity ticket and for Rubio to agree to be Cruzs Vice Presidential pick uniting the outsider and insider factions of the party and stopping Trump in the process The nonTrump faction has the delegates to stop Trump But now there must be unityConservative Reviews Daniel Horowitz Cruz is the only one who can win back enough of the conservative voters Trump is winning  Rubio lacks the ability to make inroads to those voters and many of Cruzs voters would go to Trump instead of Rubio were Cruz to drop out The Florida senator dominated the media coverage and endorsements for the entire week yet he failedBill Kristol the executive editor of the Weekly Standard was a little more sanguineCruz and Rubio together have won more votes and more delegates than Trump so far he said So they just have to combine Simple CruzRubio 2016For Democrats the political revolution is not to beHillary Clinton accelerated her march to the Democratic nomination She swept the South with the exception of Oklahoma which has few delegates After getting whooped in New Hampshire she showed she can win in New England by carrying Massachusetts It was the closest contest of the night on the Democratic side she prevailed by a point but a win is a winBernie Sanders did not make the inroads he needed to among minority voters None of the states with large African American and Latino populations were even close HRC extinguished the Bern in Alabama 7819 Arkansas 6630 Georgia 7128 Tennessee 6632 Texas 6533 and Virginia 6435But but but By winning four states Sanders got a rationale to carry on He prevailed in the Colorado and Minnesota caucuses demonstrating that he can continue forcing Clinton to spend money and tack leftward Speaking in his home state of Vermont which he won handily he pledged to stay in until all 50 states have voted Delegates are awarded proportionally so Sanders will still get some from the states where he got blown out The Sanderscampaign invited reporters to a path forward breakfast later this morning where theyll outline a theory of the case By Saturday the senator will campaign in Maine Michigan Nebraska Kansas Missouri Illinois and Ohio And hell have the money to stay in as long as he wants he raised 42 million in February including 6 million on Monday aloneStill all the pundits are calling the race for Clinton The Sanders challenge was doomed by a fatal flaw Democrats arent as unhappy as he needed them to be Dana Milbank writes While 89 percent of Republicans think were on the wrong track only 34 percent of Democrats doOur exit poll in Virginia found that six in 10 Democratic voters wanted to continue Obamas policies Clinton won those voters by about 60 points while Sanders held a 2to1 lead among those who wanted more liberal policies Experience was the most desired quality About a third of voters picked it as the most important attribute in choosing who to vote for and Hillary won nine in 10 of them Every Republican incumbent with a primary challenge survived Alabama Sen Richard Shelby avoided a runoff by pulling 65 percent of the vote So did GOP incumbent Reps Martha Roby and Bradley ByrneThe Birmingham Newsreports Andin Texas House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions each easily won Kelsey SnellRubios suburban strategy did pay some dividends He came within 3 points of winning Virginia because of his strength in the suburbs outside DC and Richmond But Trump overwhelmed his competitors in more rural areas including the Shenandoah Valley to the west and the Tidewater region in the south and drew enough votes in the suburbs to emerge victorious Paul Schwartzman explains Trump was able to hold off Rubio in part because Kasich also took votes in Northern Virginia including 16 percent in Fairfax City and 12 percent in Falls ChurchFrom our Virginia exit poll 55 percent of Republican voters said they would be dissatisfied with Trump becoming the partys nominee Those who made up their minds in the past week broke for Rubio over Trump 3919 Trump won men by 10 points but lost women to Rubio by five points Trump won voters who have no more than a high school diploma by 29 points Rubio won Republicans with college degrees Ken Cuccinelli has relatively little juice in his home state The former Virginia Attorney General who nearly won the governorship in 2013 went all in for Cruz He even showed up at a Rubio event on Sunday to criticize him wandering around the press pen unstaffed In the end Cruz got just 17 percent He even finished third among evangelicals Trump got 37 percent to Rubios 28 percent and Cruzs 19 percent More record turnout numbers for Republicans Four times as many voted in Virginia as in 2012 and more than twice as many as voted in 2008 Trump tried to act like the presumptive nominee during a halfhour press conference He painted Clinton as a DC insider and called himself a commonsense conservative I am a unifier he said When we unify theres nobody nobody thats going to beat usBut in Trumps always unorthodox fashion the firsttime candidate declared victory on his own terms There was no watch party with supporters Jenna Johnson notes No packed suburban hotel ballroom lined with televisions blaring results and commentary No open bar passed appetizers or themed drinks No lengthy victory speech with his wife at his side No balloons He still does not have a pollster or a speechwriter Hillary also focused her victory speech on the general with an eye on Trump America never stopped being great she said in Miami We have to make America whole we have to fill in whats been hollowed out She added Its clear tonight that the stakes of this election have never been higher And the rhetoric were hearing on the other side has never been lower In a taste of what the general election could feel like Trump said during his speech that he thinks Make America great again has a much better ring to it than Make America whole againTHE MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT OF LAST NIGHTChrisChristies pained expression as Trump spoketotally dominated the online conversationChristiespent the entire speech screaming wordlessly Alexandra Petri writes I have never seen someone scream so loudly without using his mouth before It would have been remarkable if it had not been so terrifying It was not a thousandyard stare That would understate the vast and impenetrable distance it encompassedHe looked as if he had seen a ghost and the ghost had made him
