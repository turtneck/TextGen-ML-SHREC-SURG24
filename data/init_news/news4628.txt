After a summer of dominating the Republican presidential campaign Donald Trump is moving into a new and uncertain phase that the billionaire businessman acknowledges will be more challenging than any project he has ever undertaken  even as he views the nomination as now within his reachIn an hourlong interview with The Washington Post at his 26thfloor office in Trump Tower the Republican frontrunner ruminated on the many obstacles ahead Sitting at a desk piled high with magazine covers bearing his image and strewn with polls and other testaments to his early success Trump said he is far from satisfied with what he has accomplished to dateIf you dont win what have I done Ive wasted time he said I want to make America great again and you cant do that if you come in a close secondTrump laid out for the first time in detail the elements of what will be the second chapter of his 2016 bid signaling an evolution toward a somewhat more traditional campaign Trump is preparing his first television ads with a media firm that is new to politics Melania his wife and Ivanka his daughter areplanning public appearances highlighting womens health issues to help close Trumps empathy gap with female votersTrump is also publishing a book and planning to roll out policies on reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and on trade and Chinas currency manipulations And he is deepening his political organization far beyond the early states with top advisers vowing that his fight for the nomination will go all the way to the floor of the Republican National ConventionTrump who is mostly selffunding his campaign said he had originally budgeted up to 20 million through midSeptember for television advertising But so far he has not spent anything to go on theairwaves since he is so often on them Its been all Trump all the time  If you had an ad people would ODBut he and his aides said that would soon change His campaign says it has hired a Floridabased advertising firm and Trump said he has proposed several concepts for ads in the worksI have such a great concept  in fact so good Trump said declining to specifyCampaign manager Corey Lewandowski said Trumps team would probably spend considerably more than 20 million on paid media later this year  whatever it takes He said the spots would be nontraditional saying the firm which he and Trump declined to name has never created political adsCentral to the fall strategy is the release later this month of a book that will serve as a campaign manifesto During the interview Trump showed off the cover and title Crippled America and held up pages of the galleys which he was editing by hand Its actually the hardest Ive worked on a book since The Art of the Deal he said referring to his 1987 bestseller I dont want to have a stupid statement in the book that people are going to say Hey why did he say thatTrump said he does not believe the next stage of the campaign will require him to change his flamboyant confrontational style which has captivated the attention of voters whether they support him or not But he noted that running for president has brought pressures and demands that he did not experience in the business world and had not anticipated in the political arenaIts very unforgiving he said If you make a mistake that can be very easily explained it can still be turned around and then you have three bad days of press over something that actually wasnt even a big dealTrump said he doesnt want to significantly tinker with how he presents himself to the public As Lewandowski put it Trump remains TrumpIts going to be the same thing Trump said Youve got to have a personality Youve got to be able to speak your mind Youve got to have some thoughts that are correctHow Donald Trump left his mark on New York CityTrump said he is readying for an eventual winnowing of the Republican field but he disagreed with some predictions that the contest will narrow to just two or three finalists for the nomination I think youll go past New Hampshire and youll have four or five people left he saidHis advisers are working to assure that Trump will qualify for the ballot in all 50 states and the US territories  an arduous and timeconsuming task that has caused some firsttime candidates to stumble Lewandowski said the campaign has hired a company that will work only for Trump to meet the statebystate requirements Virginia is among the most difficult states but Lewandowski said Trump will be qualified there by the end of this monthIll be happy to be the underestimated campaign Lewandowski said If I dont get Mr Trump on the ballot which is the nutsandbolts part of my job I should be fired immediatelyTrumps campaign headquarters is on the fifth floor of Trump Tower here in an industrial space that previously had been a construction area and hangout for the crew of NBCs The ApprenticeThe main room is a showcase for Trumps penchant for boastful teasing A wall of shame features downcast photos of the two candidates who have dropped out Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker and former Texas governor Rick Perry It also highlights his proclaimed frugality as aides work at plastic picnic tables and sit on folding chairsCompared with the bustling Brooklyn headquarters of Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton with hundreds of staffers on the payroll Trumps Manhattan command center is barren Lewandowski said about a dozen aides are at the location including political director Michael Glassner and spokeswoman Hope HicksTrump has between seven and 12 paid staffers in each of the first three voting states  Iowa New Hampshire and South Carolina  and is hiring in Florida Georgia Tennessee Texas and other states Lewandowski said Trump enjoys amassive grassroots network allowing volunteers to feed local intelligence on rival campaigns to New YorkAsked if he had discussed an exit plan with Trump should the candidate slip in the polls Lewandowski said he had not Were going to the convention  thats it One delegate or 2000 and change were going to the convention and theres nobody who can get him out of the raceAlongside Trump campaign activist clashes are getting uglierFrom behind his desk with Central Park over his shoulder and with no television cameras rolling Trump presented a less strident and combative persona than the one that has become a familiar presence on television He was conversational and at ease even introspective at times while still displaying high sensitivity to perceived slights and unfair media coverageTrump held up last weekends New York Times Magazine which included a cover he did not like of a cartoonish Trump as a rising balloon Then he flipped to an inside page with a blackandwhite portrait of him intensely pointing his finger at the camera Look at this he said arguing that the photo should have been on the cover Its the greatest picture Ive ever hadDuring a tour of his office suite Trump  ever aware of his image  laughingly declined a reporters request to pose for a photograph holding up an oil painting of himself that he said had been sent by a supporter Youd make me look so badThe interview did not focus on his opponents and Trump spent almost no time talking about them He has often said he is a counterpuncher who attacks primarily when provoked But he appears to have at least one exception Mitt Romney Asked about recent criticism from the 2012 GOP nominee Trump made clear he fired the first shot I dont blame him because Ive been very tough on Romney he said Hes a choke artistTrump claimed credit for keeping Romney out of the 2016 race though he bowed out long before Trump ever became a candidate Dismissing the suggestion that it was former Florida governor Jeb Bushs fundraising prowess that kept Romney from the race Trump insisted He got scared away by me By my mouthMitt Romney Trump will not be the nomineeThroughout the interview Trump exuded customary aplomb but nonetheless indicated there are aspects of his performance that he can improve He said he sensed he had won the first debate outright but suggested the second debate had been less satisfyingI was angry about the second debate he said complaining about the overheated room and that three hours was one hour too many You cant hold peoples attention he said Gone With the Wind was three hours okayHe countered criticism that he had almost disappeared during much of the final hour People said Oh he faded at the end Trump said I didnt fade They didnt ask me any questions Now I could have butted in like some people were doing but I didnt think it was appropriateTrump said that in the next debate which will be held Oct 28 in Boulder Colo he will change tactics and insert himself more energetically in an effort to put questions about his previous performance to restTrumps candidacy has been fueled by his loud swagger and his hardline views on immigration But in the coming weeks he hopes to bolster and reorient his message with an eye toward bluecollar votersIm a person who is capable of going into far greater detail than any of my opponents he said an assertion likely to be tested by rivals But he said the calls for him to do so come mainly from reporters and pundits Ive never had a voter stand up and say Could you release policy papersA major component will be a tough new approach to China which he said has emasculated the United States through trade and currency manipulationIve been working hard on the China thing Trump said Its astronomical what they have done to our country to destroy the economics of our country Astronomical Its the greatest theft in world historyDonald Trump We have to take back the heart of our countryTrumps competitors have suggested that he has little depth on international affairs After being ridiculed for saying this summer that he gets much of his foreign policy advice by watching military experts on television talk shows Trump has begun to seek counsel from some generals directly Lewandowski saidThe strife in Syria has become a staple of Trumps stump speech and it is an area where he has begun to differentiate himself from others in his party with a stance that sounds decidedly more cautious In the interview he questioned those who are advocating more direct military intervention by the United StatesThey basically want to start World War III over Syria he said If were going to have World War III its not going to be over Syria  I wont even call them hawks I call them the foolsImmigration continues to be the issue that has largely defined his candidacy though he said in the interview he was surprised at the strength of the response he has gotten with his inflammatory language about Mexican rapists and criminals I had no idea it was going to resonate in the way it has he saidTrump also said he plans to talk even more about the role of money in politics and what he described as an incestuous relationship between candidates the donor class and their allied super PACsLooking to boost his favorability with women Trump plans to spotlight his wife and daughter whose passion for womens health issues could help soften the candidates edges Asked if they shared his opposition to abortion Trump demurred Im going to let them reveal themselves if people are going to ask that question which they might not he saidGlancing at an office wall covered in mementos and awards Trump picked up a campaign bumper sticker featuring his name in thick red letters A hot ticket Trump declared smiling proudlyI believe in the power of positive thinking he said but I never like to talk it Its never in sight until you win it You know there are a lot of minefields out there
