Hezbollahs Candidate Becomes Lebanese President After Sunni Compromise Posted on Nov 1 2016 By Juan Cole  Informed Comment Lebanon finally has a president Michel Aoun  In accordance with the countrys national pact he is a Maronite Christian a Catholic uniate church and happens to be a former general The US and Israel wont be pleased that he is a strong ally of the Shiite Hizbullah partymilitia and a backer of the Bashar alAssad regime in Syria Most Levantine Christians are either neutral or proAssad virtually none support the Syrian rebels now mainly fundamentalists Well Americans who are eager for their own presidential election to be over with should imagine what it would be like for the contest to go on another 25 years before it was resolved Thats what Lebanese have had to put up with Of course it has a parliamentary form of government so most power is anyway in the hands of the prime minister and the cabinet But still and all not being able to elect a president has been a black mark on the parliament The parliament which hasnt been able to supply the Lebanese with water electricity or garbage collection and which has twice extended its term of service since 2013 so that it is well past its sellby date could hardly take more black marks Lebanon has been deeply polarized since 2004 when it was occupied by thousands of Syrian troops who had originally come during the civil war of 19751989 Syria liked the then president and wanted to see his term extended for three years without a new election which contravened the constitution Prime Minister Rafik alHariri angrily resigned over this Syrian pressure and then it is likely the Syrian secret police or a Lebanese client of same blew Hariri up on 14 February 2005 Maronite Christians and Sunni Arabs Hariri was Sunni then mobilized in vast crowds to demand that Syria withdraw from Lebanon beginning March 14 which became their name They were countered by the Shiite Hizbullah which had demonstrated in favor of Syria on March 8 But in the end Syria couldnt stay and withdrew its troops In a great irony one of the demands of March 14 was that Gen Michel Aoun be allowed to return to Lebanon which he did But after a while he left the coalition and allied instead with Hizbullah and Syria Advertisement Square Site wide Politics in Lebanon is kaleidoscopic In the past nearly two and a half years Hizbullah has been trying to get Aoun elected But the election of the president is by parliament and it needs a 23s majority to prevail AntiHizbullah forces just stayed away from scheduled votes and denied the chamber a quorum There are 128 members of parliament ordinarily but one resigned last year and so there are only 127 since no new parliamentary elections have been held since 2013 On Monday Aoun fell short of the required 86 votes for a 23s majority on the first ballot After that the candidate could be elected with a simple majority The next two votes were voided because they turned up 128 ballots meaning someone voted twice On the fourth ballot the box was brought in the center of the parliamentary chamber and a close eye was kept on it so only 127 votes were cast Aoun received well over the required majority at that point with 83 votes Another 36 protest votes were case blank and 7 were voided because of unspecified irregularities Aoun succeeded because he was not boycotted by the Future Bloc of Saudibacked Sunni politician Saad Hariri son of the slain former PM Hariri had had his own candidate Sleiman Frangieh who however is just as proSyrian as Aoun Hariri used to be fabulously wealthy his father had worked in Saudi Arabia and built the family fortune there but the rumors are that his wealth is largely gone He has had trouble paying his employees from all accounts Saudi Arabia considers Lebanon to be too proIranian and cut it off from a 3 bn grant and Hariri had depended deeply on Saudi backing He faces opposition in his own party So some analysts see the alJazeera clip below think that Hariri has been so weakened that he finally agreed to let Aoun become president Aouns platform is strengthening the Lebanese army to fight ISIL and alQaeda and doing something about the burden of 15 million Syrian refugees Lebanon is only a country of 4 million His election is a win for Hizbullah his longtime ally but since Hariri joined in backing him it isnt really a loss for the Sunni Arabs of Lebanon who may be making their peace with the likelihood that the alAssad regime will survive in some form Lebanons Sunnis had strongly supported the Syrian revolution of 2011 and after and tend to be favorable toward the remnants of the Free Syrian Army But many of them have to be concerned about the influence among the rebels of an alQaedalinked group the Levantine Conquest Front and the continued challenge of Daesh ISIS ISIL Both alQaeda and Daesh had footholds in Syrian villages along the Lebanese border Aoun says his first order of business is to have parliament change the countrys unwieldy electoral law which distributes seats on a sectarian basis and on the basis of an outdated set of statistics going back in some cases to the 1930 census Lebanon held successful municipal elections last spring But most Lebanese are not holding their breath that governmental gridlock will end any time soon And with Depressionstyle unemployment the country has other problems than the political ones TAGS
