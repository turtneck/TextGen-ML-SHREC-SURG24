Leave a reply Scott Adams  Last year in this blog I told you that Trump would change more than politics I said he would forever change how you view reality Ill prove that to you today with a fun experiment At the end of this post I will give you a link to a very short video clip showing Hillary Clinton getting off her jet and into her car Trump supporters will say she looks like she is drunk or unsteady for some other healthrelated reason And they will say it is obvious  Now try showing the clip to a Clinton supporter and watch how they see nothing wrong with the way she is walking Who is right The answer is that you have no way to know Personally I can see it both ways depending on what frame of mind Im in When people on Twitter say she looks drunk and I look at the clip immediately after they prime me she indeed looks drunk When my Clintonsupporting friend says he sees nothing unusual about her walking suddenly it looks fine to me too Most of my readers today are probably Trump supporters so you are likely to see Clintons walk as unsteady Send the clip to your Clintonsupporting friend and see how much your perceptions differ on this Youll be amazed There might be an objective reality in our world But our brains didnt evolve to be able to see it Our brains only evolved to do the job of keeping us alive so we could procreate That means the reality you see  the movie in your head  can be totally different from mine and almost certainly is Yet we can both get by in this world Last year when many observers were saying Trump was a stupid underinformed clown I was saying he was a Master Persuader Pundits said he ignored facts because he didnt know them or because he was a liar I said he ignored facts because facts are useless for persuasion Trump could learn lots of facts if he wanted to do so But he knew it was a waste of time These are two totally different views of reality And yet they did not conflict Clinton supporters still see the stupid underinformed clown and I still see the Master Persuader We live in totally different movies and yet we can still interact with each other still eat and drink still procreate when necessary Reality isnt what you thought it was a year ago Your movie isnt my movie But the good news is that you have the power to rewrite the coming scenes of your movie And those scenes can be anything that isnt ruled out by your own observations Now watch this Clinton video and notice how Clintons walk matches your expectations no matter what your expectations are Thats confirmation bias  And it is the most important thing you will ever learn SF Source The Burning Platform Nov 2016 Share this
