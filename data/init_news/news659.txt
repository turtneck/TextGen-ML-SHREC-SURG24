On Wednesday I wrote about whyraising the Social Security retirement age is a particularly cruel policy to people who hate their jobs and die young  a group that tends to be poorOn Twitter the very smart Marc Goldwein who works for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget took issue with the pieceTwitter is good for a lot of things but debating the distributional impacts of changes to Social Security isnt one of them So lets move the debate hereIn case you dont want to read the rest of this heres the short version of my response a Social Security check means something very different to someone with no retirement savings than it does to someone with hefty retirement savings Cutting 11 percent of the check someone lives on and 11 percent of the check someone barely notices are not the same thing And finally cutting 11 percent of the check of someone who loves his job is very different from cutting 11 percent of the check of someone who desperately wants to retireGoldweins tweet uses a table from the Social Security administration showing that the cut lops a roughly equal percentage off the benefits of people at all income levels  and of course it does raising the retirement age is an acrosstheboard cut But a 65 percent cut to Social Security benefits for someone with no other income is much more harmful than an identical cut for someone with 100000 a year in income from retirement savingsThis debate is complicated a bit by the fact that there are actually two retirement ages for Social Security the early retirement age which is the earliest age at which someone can begin receiving benefits and the full retirement age at which Social Security grants full benefits though confusingly you can get still larger Social Security checks by retiring later than the full retirement age Some proposals raise only the early retirement age some raise only the full retirement age and some likeChris Christies plan raise both But the Congressional Budget Office finds that increasing either retirement age  or both retirement ages  hurts the poor more than the richHeres what it says about raising the early retirement ageHeres what it says about raising the full retirement ageIn both cases the basic effect is the same raising the retirement age is manageable so long as you can continue working and want to continue working But its a much bigger problem if you cant continue working or you desperately want to stop working and were going to rely on Social Security to support you in retirementWhich is to say raising the retirement age is a cut that targets people who hate their jobs and want to retire but cant do so without Social SecurityAnd then theres the fact that the poor live shorter lives than the rich If we raised the early retirement age from 62 to 65 then someone who lives until 80 would see their 18 years of retirement cut to 15 years  a loss of about 16 percent of their retirement Someone who only lives until 73 however would see their retirement cut from 11 years to eight  a loss of about 27 percent of their time in retirementThis speaks by the way to one of the main justifications given for raising the retirement age that Americans are living longer lives these days But as this chart from the Peter G Peterson Foundation shows the recent increase in life expectancy has been much larger among the affluentThis is where we get into questions not of budget but of values I think in a country as rich as ours it should be possible for people who hate their jobs to retire relatively young so they can spend a good portion of their adult life in retirement I think its easy for people who love their jobs to underestimate how soulcrushing it is to hate going into work every day And so I prefer fixes to Social Security that dont force people who hate their jobs to spend longer in the workforcePerhaps that would change if we didnt have other options for closing Social Securitys shortfall  but there are so so many other paths that it baffles me why so many in Washington have fixated on this one
