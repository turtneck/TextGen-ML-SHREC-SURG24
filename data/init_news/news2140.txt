In April President Obama announced the framework of a deal that he said would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weaponWe only have three options for addressing Irans nuclear program  cutting a deal with Iran starting another war in the Middle East or hope for the bestIn deploying his favorite rhetorical device the president reaffirmed to the world he only really saw one option cutting a deal with Iran no matter the costIf after witnessing six years of President Obamas weak and feckless foreign policy wasnt enough to embolden the regime in Tehran President Obamas comments in April must have convinced the mullahs they had the American president right where they wanted himThe price for President Obamas penchant for negotiating from weakness is now clear The deal announced with much fanfare by the White House two weeks ago comes nowhere close to the deal President Obama promised the American people hed getFar from the promise of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon the deal brokered by President Obama and Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry guarantees that the worlds foremost state sponsor of terror will be a nuclear threshold state in the next 15 years but probably much soonerThe details of the breadth and scope of President Obamas capitulations to Tehran are startling even by his standards But most alarming of all is the realization that President Obama decided to elevate an evil and illegitimate thirdrate autocracyIn order to ensure that the damage done by President Obama can be repaired we need to learn the lessons of his failuresThey began long before he reached the White House when during his campaign for the presidency he announced his willingness to meet without preconditions with the leaders of Iran Syria Venezuela Cuba and North KoreaWhen American presidents speak leaders around the world both friends and foes listen And the listening begins long before the president is sworn into office In addition how candidates aspiring for the presidency now talk about Iran will send a clear signal to the world about their foreign policy vision Our allies and adversaries alike want to know whether America will continue the retreat from the world begun by President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or will America return to its indispensable leadership role in the worldMaking that case begins now by making it clear to the American people and the world that this is President Obamas deal with Iran not Americas deal with IranThe next President must campaign for the office on the principle that has long guided American foreign policy toward Iran  that the regime cannot have mastery of dangerous nuclear technologies PeriodThe next president must reimpose the sanctions waived by President Obama and work with Congress to impose new crushing sanctions on Irans leaders for their ongoing support for terrorism and brutal human rights abusesThis will require engagement with our European allies to lead them toward a different approach to Iran than the ObamaClinton approach Part of this reengagement must make it clear that European security does not benefit by empowering Irans terrorist proxies and missiles that can hit Europes cities But the rest of the world also needs to realize that if Europe intends to pursue a strategy that empowers an unreformed Iran America will put our security interests firstThe next president must give Iran a choice change your behavior or face the collapse of your economy due to US pressure Despite its inflammatory rhetoric Irans clerical dictatorship has immense vulnerabilities Irans economy continues to suffer from inflation and unemployment while rampant corruption plagues the state at all levelsA strategy of pressure will not just focus on Irans economy but also its regional position For Irans leaders to make painful concessions they have avoided thus far they need to understand that there are consequences for their actions The US should undertake a systematic effort to isolate Iran in the Middle East The Islamic Republic its clients and proxies should find no sanctuary in the region The US must do all it can to counter Irans nefarious plots in places like Iraq Lebanon Gaza Syria or YemenThis will be advanced by shoring up our alliance with IsraelThe first step will be an end to the threatening rhetoric from senior US officials warning of Israeli isolation and dismissing Israeli government leaders who know what theyre talking aboutPresident Obamas capitulation has made it more difficult but not impossible to prevent a nuclear Iran He has failed with Iran because he has failed as president This may be the best deal that a weak president can achieve but a strong trusted and respected America can do much betterThose who aspire to lead the greatest nation on Earth cannot wait until 2017 to begin making the case for a new approach toward this critical issue to the American people and the worldRepublican
