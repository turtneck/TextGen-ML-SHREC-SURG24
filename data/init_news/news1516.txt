Share This Despite being dead for over 7 years it seems that Michael Jacksons name has just been dragged back into the spotlight once again Unfortunately for his family it looks like bad news for the stars estate as a woman leaked the 900000 sex secret he had kept quiet for a whopping 30 years  and she has proof Most people are aware of Jacksons depraved past involving children  specifically little boys However the most recent person to come forward is actually a woman who states that the deceased star had molested and sexually assaulted her about 3 decades prior According to LA Times  The alleged abuse started in 1986 and occurred in such iconic locations as Neverland Ranch the set of Moonwalker Jacksons Encino mansion and in the back of the singers limousine according to papers filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court Unfortunately for the family and Jacksons estate her word isnt all the accuser was armed with  Stock image of Michael Jacksons Neverland ranch Among the court filings are scanned copies of checks purportedly paid to her from Jackson or his entertainment companies which she says were issued to pay her off in exchange for her silence In all the checks totaled a whopping 900000  a damning number to say the least Furthermore the largest sum a check for 600000 was dated in late 1993 which just so happens to be three months after Jackson found himself in yet another lawsuit that time with a 13yearold boy saying he had been molested by the King of Pop Of course the payment comes at a time where Jackson would have wanted to ensure that all of his other skeletons remained perfectly quiet in his closet Oddly enough this is the only time a female victim has come forward to allege a Jackson sexual assault In addition to that the womans lawyer Vince Finaldi said the case offers the first evidence that Jackson and his production company  not an insurance carrier  made direct payments to an alleged abuse victim Michael Jackson Source LA Times  The abuse allegedly lasted for over 3 years beginning when the girl was merely 12 years old and ending just after her 15 th birthday LA Times adds The woman alleges that for about three years Jackson fondled her forced her to orally copulate him and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her which caused her to bleed the lawsuit states Jackson also supplied her with gifts and letters and two of the notes were attached to the lawsuit One of the letters ends Im crazy about you  All my love Michael Of course the Jackson family lawyer is saying that the entire ordeal is a madeup claim meant to do nothing more than leech off of the stars estate As the woman  being a sex assault victim  and her identity are being kept quiet for the time being its hard to say whether shes looking for a payout or something more Although this man is dead and buried and under most circumstances should be left to rest in peace no sex assault victim should ever go without justice Although money is a good way to buy silence it certainly does not equate to anything near justice In fact it represents the exact opposite as it proves that if you have enough money you can get away with anything  even sexually abusing a child This woman deserves her day in court and it certainly doesnt look like the Jackson family is going to like the end result
