With Trumps call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States several of the nations most esteemed journalists and influential news outlets have set aside traditional notions of balance and given themselves license to label the Republican frontrunner a liar a demagogue a racist and worseTom Brokaw the veteran NBC News anchor has called Trumps proposal dangerous and likened it to the Holocaust and the Japanese internment On its front page The New York Times has said Trumps idea is more typically associated with hate groups Dan Balz of The Washington Post has called Trumps rhetoric demagogic while BuzzFeed editorinchief Ben Smith has informed staff that it is acceptable to refer to Trump on social media as a mendacious racist because he said those are factsSeveral others have said Trumps proposal poses a national security threat This is not small ball actually This matters Richard Engel the NBC News chief foreign correspondent said Monday It isa black spot on our collective foreign policy and our conscience And it also just feeds into the ISIS narrativeThe willingness to use such language and draw such analogies represents a watershed moment in the medias coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign several journalists and political observers told CNN For the first time in six months news organizations are abandoning concerns about impartiality and evenhandedness and stating what they believe are objective truths about the Republicans most popular presidential candidateWhat Trump is doing is wildly outside American traditions and values and thats what were covering and responding to and I think you see that across major media outlets Smith told CNN Ive never seen a candidate base his campaign on vilifying a minority group So it would be misleading to characterize it any other wayBut the new media backlash also comes six months into a campaign that has been characterized by Trumps derogatory statements  about Mexican immigrants AfricanAmericans and others  since the day it began That has left many observers feeling like the medias newfound confidence is late in comingAs his comments have become more extreme the mainstream media has been more willing to describe him  accurately in my view  as a demagogue a national security threat and a racist But frankly his racism and demagoguery were apparent from his first speech announcing his candidacy back on June 16 said Ryan Lizza The New Yorkers Washington correspondent and CNN political analystTo be sure many journalists have been characterizing Trumps campaign in these terms for some time In August Lizza compared Trump to the farright parties in Europe and said that he was running a candidacy that is based on resentment of nonwhite peopleBut for the most part journalists stopped short of calling Trump demagogic or racist despite the fact that he has often relied on false information about minorities to appeal to popular prejudices At his campaign launch Trump called Mexican immigrants criminals drug dealers and rapists In November Trump tweeted out inaccurate homicide statistics suggesting that blacks were responsible for 81 percent of white homicides FBI statistics for 2014 put the actual number below 15 percentIf this were racism and demagoguery the mainstream media was not quick to identify it as such That may have been due at least in part to the unique nature of Trumps campaign For a long time many journalists didnt take the former reality television star seriously When he became the frontrunner despite his incendiary remarks many were simply confounded by his ability to flout the conventional rules of American politicsI think the media has struggled to cover the dark side of the Trump phenomenon because political reporters do not have experience covering a major political figure who is both openly racist and  lets be honest  an extremely entertaining politician Lizza saidTrumps call for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States changed all thatThe media began by covering Trump as a sideshow then grew more aggressive in challenging him on his facts and now is more actively commenting on the character of his campaign said David Axelrod the chief strategist on Barack Obamas presidential campaigns and CNN senior political commentatorThe new phase of Trumpmedia relations has ushered in an unusual moment in American politics said media expertsFrank Sesno director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University and a former CNN Washington bureau chief said journalism has moved into the have you no shame mode There are thresholds and several have been crossed and that blows up socalled objective reporting There are times when hesaid shesaid isnt enoughKelly McBride the vice president for Academic Programs at The Poynter Institute stressed that while some of the terms were appropriate it was important for journalists to put Trumps remarks in contextRather than just calling him racist theres more journalistic value in pointing out why its racist she said So I like it when I see newsrooms making historical analogies I like the editorials pointing out that hes dangerous and whyThe question now is what impact will the media backlash have if anyTrump has proven time and time again that incendiary remarks only bolster his support Moreover his supporters harbor little respect for the American media and often give the candidate a standing ovation when he calls the media scumFrank Rich the New York Magazine columnist said the medias disdain would only enhance his support from his fansRich Lowry the editor of National Review agreed Media disdain is a badge of honor for Trump and his supporters he said So this latest bout of criticism from the press wont hurt himPerhaps the only way the media could dent Trump would be to have him on TV less often and become less obsessed with himbut thats not going to happen Lowry added Bottom line Another Republican candidate is going to have to outmaneuver Trump or just flatout beat him Its that simple
