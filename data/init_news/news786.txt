Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker a once rising star of the GOP presidential pack has dropped out of the race Now the field is scrambling to realignJust this summer Walker led the Republican field in Iowa But on Monday he called it quits and suggested that someone could emerge from a smaller pool of candidates with a clear conservative alternative to the current frontrunner Donald TrumpToday I believe that I am being called to lead by helping to clear the race so that a positive conservative message can rise to the top of the field With that in mind I will suspend my campaign immediately he saidBut will others drop out so that support can build around an alternative to Trump None are expected to do so anytime soon In fact theyre all vying for the Walker campaign assetsSome believe that Sen Marco Rubio RFla will benefit the most from Walkers departure Theyre both considered fresh faces with next generation appealLate Monday Rubio was already welcoming Walker staff to his team as was Sen Ted Cruz RTexasThe latest CNN poll shows political outsiders Trump former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson leading the presidential pack with Rubio and former Florida Gov Jeb Bush in fourth and fifth place respectivelyMeanwhile on the Democratic side Hillary Clinton is battling off an unexpectedly strong challenge from Sen Bernie Sanders IVt Shes also waiting to see if Vice President Joe Biden decides to enter the raceIn her latest campaign move the former secretary of state is promising not only to protect Obamacare from GOP plans to repeal it  but to improve itAs the latest census numbers show the number of uninsured continues to fall and Americans are now seeing hearing and feeling the full benefits of the Affordable Care Act a Clinton campaign official said SaturdayIts already a presidential campaign year that no one could have predicted and voters have never had so many candidates to considerBut whether any of them will follow Walkers advice to lead by falling back is unlikely for now
