Urban Population Booms Will Make Climate Change Worse Posted on Oct 27 2016 By Tim Radford  Climate News Network Flooded slums in the denselypopulated city of Jakarta Indonesia Kent Clark via Flickr LONDONThe worlds cities are growing even faster than the human population Within the last 40 years the global population has increased by a factor of 18 but builtup areas have multiplied 25 times  All of this information and much more appears in a new European Commission EC publication called the Atlas of the Human Planet  prepared to coincide with the recent third UN Habitat conference in Quito Ecuador The Atlas shows that 40 years ago most of the worlds 41billion population lived in rural areas Now more than half live in towns and citiesurban clusters that cover 76 of the planets land mass equivalent to an area about half the size of the European Union Most of the people in the world are crammed into urban centres with a density greater than 1500 persons per square kilometre and in settlements greater than 50000 inhabitants Altogether geographers have identified 13000 urban centres altogether surrounded by 300000 urban clusters of at least 5000 inhabitants living at a density of 300 per square kilometre Population tripled And in the 40 years since the first UN Habitat conference in 1976 the population of Africa has tripled while the builtup area of the continent has quadrupled In wealthy Europe the population remained stable but the builtup area doubled The research for the Atlas has been enriched by a new free open and global dataset the Global Human Settlement Layer  developed by the ECs Joint Research Centre  and based on 12400 billion individual satellite data readings over the past four decades It provides in every sense an overview of a planet at work and at rest and struggling to survive It confirms what most people would have suspected that nine of the 10 most densely populated urban centresincluding Cairo in Egypt Guangzhou in China and Jakarta in Indonesiaare in the lowincome countries Researchers warn that whatever problems these new citydwellers have will be compounded by climate change The largest urban centre in the world is Los Angeles in the US eight of the 10 largest urban centres are in the highincome countries and five of those are in the US And a group of scientists led by Timon McPhearson assistant professor of urban ecology at the New School in New York  publish a warning in Nature journal that more urban areas will be built in the next 30 years than ever before just to house and shelter the additional 11billion people expected in the next 14 yearsmost of them in the crowded cities of Asia and Africa Whatever problems these new citydwellers have will be compounded other researchers warn by climate change with ever more frequent and intense heatwaves droughts floods  and days of bad air quality Around 40 of the worlds people live in coastal cities and are therefore increasingly vulnerable to floods  tsunamis surges and tropical storms Because of the notorious urban heat island effect cities are inevitably hotter than the surrounding countryside  and many are likely to face a crisis in the supply of safe clean water  Swelling cities The new Atlas warns that the new swelling cities will go on making ever greater demands on the farmland and wilderness beyond the citys boundaries In the last 15 years 27000 sq km of land was covered by housing workshops and pavement This is an area equal to Cyprus and Israel combined If this growth continues at the present rate an additional 11 million sq km of land will become builtup between 2015 and 2040an area equal to the size of Ethiopia In 119 countries the urban population is between 70 and 90 of the total In 25 countriesmost of them in Asiathe city dwellers make up 90 of the population Many of these are in megacities The atlas records 50 urban clusters of more than 10 million people and one gigacityBeijingthat is home to more than 100 million Inevitably in this growth explosion the poorest are often most at risk from floods landslides and other geophysical and climaterelated potential disasters In the last 40 years the number of people living at or even below sea level has almost doubled from 45 million to 88 million and the number living on steep slopes has increased from 70 million to 160 million Tim Radford a founding editor of Climate News Network worked for The Guardian for 32 years for most of that time as science editor He has been covering climate change since 1988 Advertisement
