The Islamist terrorist attacks that took place almost simultaneously in five locations across Paris last Friday night were shocking in scale and unprecedented in Europe over the past decade 129 killed immediately 352 injured of whom 99 are in critical condition a countrywide state of emergency declaredthousands of troops deployed to Paris demonstrations forbidden in the IledeFrance region encompassing the French capital border checks reimposed The death toll would be bad enough alone but that one of the assailants entered Europe in October via Greece as a Syrian refugee compounds the fear and dread resulting from the massacre Hundreds of thousands of migrants two out of three of whom are malehave poured into Europe this year and a majority are from Muslim Syria Iraq and Afghanistan Some of the other attackers were French or Belgianborn MuslimsFrench President Franois Hollande the following day addressed his people denouncing an act of war that was prepared organized and planned from the outside with complicity within our country that our investigation will allow us to establish He named the entity behind the perpetrators the terrorist army Daesh  ISIS  a jihadist armyand promised that France would act pitilessly against Daesh barbarians The barbarians motive They sought tostrike at the values we defend all over the world at that which we are a free country that speaks to the entire planetOf the other potential motives  avenging the ongoing French bombing raids against ISIS in Iraq and Syria plus the twoyear French antiIslamist military intervention in West Africa  Hollande had nothing to sayISIS contained President Obama for his part having the previous day declared ISIS contained called the ISIS massacre an attack on all of humanity and the universal values that we share carried out by those with a hateful vision Just what sort of hateful vision he declined to specify Not that we by this point expected him to Clearly though our values are not as universal as he would have us thinkISIS however is never coy or evasive in explaining why it does what it does and emitted a communique of arresting clarity explaining its motives a group of believers from the soldiers of the Caliphate    set out targeting the capital of prostitution and vice the leadcarrier of the cross in Europe  Paris They did so hoping to be killed for Allahs sake doing so in support of His religion    His Prophet    and His allies They cast terror into the hearts of crusaders in their very own homeland and then detonated their suicide belts with the result that Allah granted them what they desired  martyrdom France and its allies the text went on to state will continue to be at the top of the target list for the Islamic State    as long as they partake in their crusader campaign as long as they dare to curse our Prophet and as long as they boast about their war against Islam in France and their strikes against Muslims in the lands of the Caliphate with their jetsAny rational individual hoping to make sense of why so many people lost their lives in Paris last Friday night could do no better than dispense with the proclamations issued by presidents Hollande and Obama and just read ISISs explanation The facts it presents are clear and indisputableISIS attacked France because France is leading a crusade bombarding it in Syria and Iraq and unmentioned but surely relevant crushing the Islamist insurgency in West Africa On secularist constitutional grounds France has banned Islamic headgear from schools aspotentially divisive ostentatious religious symbols and outlawed wearing faceconcealing veils in public places as threats to security and national cohesion as well as being inimical to personal freedom the equivalent for ISIS of waging a war against Islam France stood behind the satirical cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo and free speech ideals after a pair of Islamist brothers assassinated 12of them last January for repeatedly depicting the Prophet Muhammad which for ISIS amounts to cursing him The ISIS assailants sought and mostly received death for the sake of their faith  martyrdom  just as the Quran promisesNote the communiques defiant triumphal tone  the tone of victors Note concomitantly the absence of all the factors to which Islamist apologists have ascribed as contributing to Islamist violence committed by French citizens of mostly North African descent in the past nary a word about discrimination racism lack of opportunity youth unemployment police brutality or poverty in Parisian suburbs This is not to say that these factors had no role to play in disposing the Frenchborn assailants to play their role in the attacks  they may have But the primum mobile for ISIS transpires as unmistakably politicoreligious natural given that Islam blends faith and politics buttressed to be sure by the virulent excoriations of infidels found in the Quran  France is attacking ISIS in the Middle East and thus acting as crusaders and thwarting the unhindered observance of Islam in France France is thus impeding the advance of Islam the True Religion and thus must incur Gods wrathNow no fair observer of the growing religioninspired chaos we see around us today would contend that all Muslims be they in Europe or elsewhere crave martyrdom and are ready to kill for it or even pose a security threat What is clear though is that the doctrine of jihad as laid out in the Islamic canon does repeatedly motivate lethal instances of terrorist violence We dont need to furrow our brows and deduce this from abstruse pronouncements ISIS jihadists themselves are telling us why they are acting just as alQaida once did They are proudly showing themselves in action check out if you can stomach it ISISs own videosAnd lest you labor under the misconception that as Obama has said  ISIS has nothing to do with Islam read and share Graeme Woods exhaustive account in the Atlanticof the movement and its aims ISIS is not Islamic There exists no Islamic equivalent of the pope to make such a determination Woods report shreds this ridiculous assertion anyway That Hollande and Obama choose to avoid such blunt causal attribution makes shortsighted political sense Frances population may be by now 10 percent Muslim Obama does not want to alienate Muslim communities in the United States whose cooperation he needs to track radicalized youths nor does he wish to endanger American interests abroad by demonizing as we are so often inclined to say now Islam as a whole We get all that The underlying assumption however  that Muslims must be placated or they may explode into violence  may be less obvious In any case by avoiding the issue  the jihadist problems the generally accepted Islamic canon presents us with  our leaders hinder our having conversations we need to have our asking questions we simply must ask Namely what are we to do about the strongly illiberal convictionsheld the data demonstrate by majorities of Muslims across the Islamic world convictions that surely have stymied any united Muslim attempt to counter ISIS Muslim migrants are now entering Europe unchecked in any meaningful way in record numbers Given that Muslim majorities support making Sharia the official law of their lands believe one must believe in God to be moral and that religious leaders should play a role in politics hold that wives must obey their husbands and favor stoning adulterers and putting to death apostates how if at all are Western societies to adapt Majorities Pew found also profess to approve of democracy and religious freedom which are simply incongruous with the beliefs just canvassed How will peace and comity in our increasingly multicultural multiconfessional societies be possible if one group adheres to and acts upon violent and divisive dogmas inscribed in immutable ancient texts What is the best policy Western governments can enact in the Islamic world given that military intervention has proved disastrous and counterproductive supporting secular dictators has resulted eventually in morasses of strife and mayhem and key Western allies Saudi Arabia Qatar and Kuwait are clearly playing a double game by accepting Western backing yet propagating fundamentalist Islam Its a safe bet that neither Hollande nor Obama has answers to these questions If we refuse to address these issues terrorist attacks will likely multiply and push our politics ever further to the right We may well then end up in police states with security organs even more pervasive and intrusive than they are now Or even more perniciously confused about what is at stake we may continue our slide into craven accommodationism into accepting illiberal beliefs and resulting behavior as the offlimits patrimony of various religious and national groups thereby consigning to the dust bin of history oncelauded ideals of universal human rights This is just what Islamophobia denouncers are after We should always bear in mind that there is only one Universal Declaration on Human Rights and it grants no exceptions on the basis of religion or culture That one or another faith happens to boast a majority of nonwhite adherents does not make criticism of that faith racist Islam in particular has universalist pretensions and so must be liable to criticism by all We need to junk finally the preposterous claim advanced by the religions apologists that Islam cannot motivate violence If our politicians wont come clean about the parlous juncture at which we find ourselves we have to We must regain confidence in and appreciation for our Enlightenment and Western values  reason equal rights for all regardless of race gender sexual orientation or faith and consensusbased decisions and the rule of law established not by ancient texts but by elected legislatures operating under the aegis of a secular constitution The societies the West has builtas imperfect as they areoffer such grand prospects for human happiness and prosperity that they are drawing millionsfrom less fortunate lands millions who may have little understanding of what makes these societies work We cannot betray those seekers of a better that is more secular life among them especially women and children by jettisoning our values under pressure from accommodationists who often attack straight thinkers as politically incorrect We either buck up and stand by our Enlightenment values promoting them with zeal or we willreap a savage whirlwind andlose all that we cherish
