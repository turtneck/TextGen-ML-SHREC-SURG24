The war on coal is not just political rhetoric or a paranoid fantasy concocted by rapacious polluters Its real and its relentless Over the past five years it has killed a coalfired power plant every 10 days It has quietly transformed the US electric grid and the global climate debateThe industry and its supporters use war on coal as shorthand for a ferocious assault by a hostile White House but the real war on coal is not primarily an Obama war or even a Washington war Its a guerrilla war The front lines are not at the Environmental Protection Agency or the Supreme Court If you want to see how the fossil fuel that once powered most of the country is being battered by enemy forces you have to watch state and local hearings where utility commissions and other obscure governing bodies debate individual coal plants You probably wont find much drama Youll definitely find lawyers from the Sierra Clubs Beyond Coal campaign the boots on the ground in the war on coalBeyond Coal is the most extensive expensive and effective campaign in the Clubs 123year history and maybe the history of the environmental movement Its gone largely unnoticed amid the furor over the Keystone pipeline and President Barack Obamas efforts to regulate carbon but its helped retire more than one third of Americas coal plants since its launch in 2010 one dull hearing at a time With a vast war chest donated by Michael Bloomberg unlikely allies from the business world and a strategy that relies more on economics than ecology its team of nearly 200 litigators and organizers has won battles in the Midwestern and Appalachian coal belts in the reddest of red states in almost every state that burns coalTheyre sophisticated theyre very active and theyre better funded than we are says Mike Duncan a former Republican National Committee chairman who now heads the industrybacked American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity I dont like what theyre doing were losing a lot of coal in this country But they do show upCoal still helps keep our lights on generating nearly 40 percent of US power But it generated more than 50 percent just over a decade ago and the big question now is how rapidly its decline will continue Almost every watt of new generating capacity is coming from natural gas wind or solar the coal industry now employs fewer workers than the solar industry which barely existed in 2010 Utilities no longer even bother to propose new coal plants to replace the old ones they retire Coal industry stocks are tanking and analysts are predicting a new wave of coal bankruptciesThis is a big deal because coal is Americas top source of greenhouse gases and coal retirements are the main reason US carbon emissions have declined 10 percent in a decade Coal is also Americas top source of mercury sulfur dioxide and other toxic air pollutants so fewer coal plants also means less asthma and lung diseasenot to mention fewer coalash spills and coalmining disasters The shift toward cleanerburning gas and zeroemissions renewables is the most important change in our electricity mix in decades and while Obama has been an ally in the war on coalnot always as aggressive an ally as the industry claimsthe Sierra Club is in the trenchesThe US had 523 coalfired power plants when Beyond Coal began targeting them just last week it celebrated the 190th retirement of its campaign in Asheville NC culminating a threeyear fight that had been featured in the climate documentary Years of Living Dangerously Beyond Coal isnt the stereotypical Sierra Club campaign treehuggers shouting savetheEarth slogans Yes it sometimes deploys its 24 millionmember grassroots army to shutter plants with traditional notinmybackyard organizing and righttobreathe agitating But it usually wins by arguing that ditching coal will save ratepayers moneyBehind that argument lies a revolution in the economics of power changes few Americans think about when they flick their switches Coal used to be the cheapest form of electricity by far but its gotten pricier as its been forced to clean up more of its mess while the costs of gas wind and solar have plunged in recent years Now retrofitting old coal plants with the pollution controls needed to comply with Obamas limits on soot sulfur and mercury is becoming costprohibitiveand the EPA is finalizing its new carbon rules as well as tougher ozone restrictions that should add to the burden Thats why the Sierra Club finds itself in foxholes with bigbox stores manufacturers and other business interests fighting coal upgrades that would jack up electricity bills pushing for cheaper renewables and energy efficiency instead In a case I watched in Oklahoma City every stakeholder supported Beyond Coals push for a utility to buy more lowcost wind powerincluding a coalition of industrial customers that reportedly included a Koch Industriesowned paper millTheyre not burning bras Theyre fighting dollar to dollar says attorney Jim Roth who represented a group of hospitals on Beyond Coals side in the Oklahoma case Theyve become masters at bringing financial arguments to environmental questionsAs the affordability case for coal has lost traction the industrys defenders have portrayed the war on coal as a war on reliability an assault on 24hour baseload plants that provide juice when the sun isnt shining and the wind isnt blowing They ask how the Sierra Club expects America to run its refrigerators around the clocksince it also opposes nuclear power and has a separate Beyond Gas campaign Duncans group started a Twitter meme warning that Americans could end up ColdInTheDark and even Bloomberg suggested to me in a recent interview that the Clubs leaders seem to want Americans to wear loincloths and live in cavesIn fact neither the decline of coal nor the boom in renewables has blacked out the grid and Beyond Coals leaders are confident electricity markets can handle much more intermittent power In any case they see coal as the lowesthanging fruit in the struggle to stabilize the climate not only our dirtiest fossil fuel but the one with the cheapest alternatives In the long run combating global warming will depend on a multitude of factors from electric vehicles to carbon releases from deforestation to methane releases from belching cows but for the next decade our climate progress depends mostly on reducing our reliance on the black stuff Coal retirements have enabled Obama to pledge US emissions cuts of up to 28 percent by 2025 which has in turn enabled him to strike a climate deal with China and pursue a global deal later this year in ParisWeve found the secret sauce to making progress in unlikely places says Bruce Nilles who leads Beyond Coal from the Clubs San Francisco headquarters And every time we beat the coal boys people say Whoa It can be done The Sierra Club cant claim full credit for the coal bust It didnt ratchet down the prices of gas wind and solar or enact the flurry of EPA rules ratcheting up the price of coal although its lobbyists and lawyers have pushed hard for government support for renewables while fighting in court over just about every coalrelated regulation It didnt produce the energy efficiency boom that has reined in electricity demand either Still a Bloomberg Philanthropies analysis found that at least 40 percent of US coal retirements could not have happened without Beyond Coals advocacy The status quo wields a lot of power in the heavily regulated power sector where economics and mathematics dont always beat politics and inertia The case for change keeps getting stronger but someone has to make the caseWhen Mary Anne Hitt Beyond Coals national director first visited Indianapolis to fight an innercity plant the headline in theStarwas Beyond Coals Director Faces Tough Sell in Indiana But after two years of doorknocking phonebanking and educating officials on the new realities of electricity the Sierra Club and its local partners helped shut down the plant Hitt has seen the same kind of miracle in Chicago in Omaha alongside a Paiute tribe reservation in Nevada even in coal strongholds like Kentucky Its starting to feel more like a pattern than a miracleDavid is fighting Goliath every day and David keeps winning Hitt saysEnergy analysts have a way of making Goliaths new underdog status seem inevitable Then again it wasnt long ago that their burning question about the US coal industry was not how fast it would go away but how fast it would growThe story of coal is a rich vein in the American story powering our industry our railroads our politics For decades the work of extracting coal after millions of years undergroundso dangerous for some so lucrative for otherswas seen as Gods work The alchemy of converting coal into valuable energy was seen as a fulfillment of Americas destiny to exploit nature for the benefit of mankind even as the smog spewing out of coal smokestacks was seen as part of the dystopia of urban lifeThese days growing concerns about climate have heightened concerns about coal which produces 75 percent of the power sectors carbon and more emissions than all our cars and trucks combined But even at the dawn of the 21stcentury the George W Bush administrations main concern about coal power and fossil energy in general was that the US wasnt producing enough of it In 2001 an energy task force led by Dick Cheney after a series of secret meetings with fossilfuel executives called for a new powerplant construction boom warning that the alternative was a national reprise of the rolling blackouts that had just roiled California Utilities quickly proposed about 200 new coal plants and faced no organized national opposition Coal plants have a useful lifespan of at least 40 years so the US was poised to lock in a new generation of dirty power And all that new capacity was poised to destroy any incentive to develop clean wind or solar powerThats when the Sierra Club got into its first big coal fight over a proposed billiondollar plant south of Chicago a welcometotheNFL episode The Chicago area already had poor air qualitythe coal plants around the Loop were known as the Ring of Fireand local volunteers led by an indefatigable German immigrant named Verena Owen were desperate to block the project Their cause seemed hopeless but for Owen who is now Beyond Coals lead volunteer it was personal Her best friend had struggled to breathe whenever the air was hazy and eventually died of lung disease leaving behind a daughter in kindergarten I dont know how many people we ended up saving but I know one we didnt Owen saysThe first time Nilles at the time a lawyer for the Sierra Clubs Midwest office in Chicago tried to attend a hearing about the plant union members who supported the project came early and packed the hall while the Club was holding a news conference Illinois regulators soon rubberstamped the permit Owen and Nilles can still recite the date and time of the news dump Friday Oct 10 2003 at 510 pm so the bureaucrats could ignore their calls and escape for the weekend And the industry had an even easier time of it elsewhere Nilles later reviewed the record for another billiondollar plant that broke ground in Iowa about the same time and discovered there hadnt been a single public comment in oppositionEverything was going full speed in the wrong direction and we had no capacity to fight he says We realized we needed a strategy FastThe strategy that Nilles devised was to fight every new plant from every conceivable environmental economic and political angle The Sierra Club began organizing boot camps to teach lawyers and volunteers around the region how to block coal permits Demand for the seminars was so intense that at one point Nilles boss had to remind him that Texas was not part of the Midwest But he figured Texans who breathed air and drank water had as much to lose from exposure to coalfired pollutants as Midwesterners had Some of the Clubs funders thought his fighteverythingeverywhere approach was unrealistic during a national coal rush but every proposed plant was in someones backyard and the Club had members in every corner of the country Nilles couldnt imagine telling any of them their communities would have to be sacrificed for the greater tactical goodEnvironmentalists have always been good at blocking stuff and over the next few years the kitchensink strategy produced some improbable victories Nilles exploited threats to an endangered clover to delay the Chicagoarea plant and the utility eventually abandoned it A local Sierra Club chapter stopped a massive plant in Kentucky coal country after a 63day hearing convincing regulators that the proposal had inadequate pollution controls and that adequate controls would be exorbitant for ratepayers These were shoestring crusades with expert witnesses crashing on the couches of volunteers but the victories felt contagious spreading hope to activists in other states who read about them on the Clubs coal listservMeanwhile the Sierra Club was canvassing its members to develop a new longterm strategic plan To the surprise of thenDirector Carl Pope they overwhelmingly wanted climate and energy to be the top priority a major shift for a group that had emphasized wilderness conservation since its creation by the legendary outdoorsman John Muir At a meeting in Tucson in early 2006 the Clubs board voted to build the fledgling Midwestern anticoal effort into a national campaign Climate activists are often accused of wasting energy on symbolic movementbuilding efforts with relatively limited impact on emissions like their crusades to stop Keystone and get universities to divest from fossil fuels Beyond Coals leaders do oppose the pipeline and support the divestment movement but the rationale for the campaign was all about hunting where the ducks areIt was existential necessity Look how many coal plants they want to build Look how much carbon theyd produce Well its game over if we dont stop them Pope recalls If we were going to focus on climate we had to focus on coalIn a bow to political realism the initial goal was to make sure coal was mined responsibly burned cleanly and disposed of safely But the campaigners didnt really believe coal could be burned cleanly The original mouthful of a mission soon evolved to Move Beyond Coal then just Beyond Coal It was a much simpler message helping to unite a variety of activistsworking for specific neighborhoods Indian tribes mountains targeted by mining outfits public health environmental justice clean energy and the climateagainst a common enemy The Sierra Club would be the one constant presence in the war on coal but it began partnering with more than 100 local regional and national groups in its battles around the countryThe campaign was remarkably successful Nilles and his team scoured every permit application for vulnerabilitiesand managed to block all but 30 of the 200 plants proposed in the Bush era The nice thing about fighting new plants was that they didnt exist yet so it only took one deal breakertoo much smog in a highsmog area too close to a national park too expensive for ratepayers whateverto break a deal Some of the plants that did get built still haunt Nilles but those defeats did not doom the decarbonization of America The game was not overBy 2008 with the economy crashing and power demand slumping utilities had stopped pushing new coal plants Thats when Nilles began plotting to go after old onesan even tougher challenge but a vital one to avoid the gameover scenario He had moved to the liberal college town of Madison and he was amazed that an old coal plant a mile from his home still had no pollution controls it was way dirtier than the new plants he was fighting around the country The nations fleet of existing coal plants was still emitting nearly 2 billion tons of carbon and causing an estimated 13000 premature deaths every year It felt good to stop projects that would have increased those numbers but Nilles wanted to use the Clubs newfound expertise to reduce themIts a lot easier to throw ourselves in front of bulldozers to stop something than it is to shut something down thats already part of the community paying taxes generating power providing jobs Nilles says But thats where the emissions areThat was also the year Obama won the presidency creating hope for stricter EPA regulation of sulfur soot and ozone plus the firstever regulations of mercury coal ash and carbon As difficult as it would be to kill plants that had been operating for decadestwothirds of the coal fleet predated the Clean Air Act of 1970Nilles thought the combination of topdown rules from Washington and bottomup pressure at state and local hearings could force utilities to confront investment decisions they had been delaying all those decades Most utilities would need approval from their financial and environmental regulators before they could install expensive pollution controls And while the utilities might be happy to charge their customers tens of millions of dollars for upgrades in order to comply with one new ruleplus a tidy profit theyre usually guaranteed for capital improvementsutility commissions might not let them start down that road if they faced hundreds of millions of dollars in additional compliance costs from rules still to comeOnce again the campaign produced some inspiring early wins including the retirement of that antiquated plant near Nilles in Madison He also filed a lawsuit against his alma mater the University of Wisconsin to get it off coal The Club quickly found that when it could stop investorowned utilities from getting a blank check to charge ratepayers for coal upgrades they would usually shut down the plants rather than risk shareholder dollars That was even true in coal country where homeowners businesses and regulators were just as allergic to pricey upgradesand utilities were just as reluctant to foot the bill themselves As Nilles new deputy Hitt a West Virginia activist who had spent years trying to stop mining companies from blowing up mountains in Appalachia found she could do more to protect the mountains by shutting down the plants that used their coalBeyond Coal had grown from three staffers to a 15state operation but it still lacked the scale to fight 523 plants all over the country It needed to get a lot bigger Thats when the combative billionaire who has financed his own wars on guns tobacco and Big Gulps took an interest in the war on coalBeyond Coals pivotal moment came at a meeting in Gracie Mansion about of all things education reform Michael Bloomberg the Wall Street savantturned media mogulturned New York City mayor was looking for a new outlet for his private philanthropy It quickly became clear that education reform would not be that outletIt was a terrible meeting in every way and Mike was angry recalls his longtime adviser Kevin Sheekey I said Look if you dont like this idea thats fine Well bring you another He said No I want anothernowAs it happened Sheekey had just eaten lunch with Carl Pope who was starting a 50 million fundraising drive to expand Beyond Coals staff to 45 states The capandtrade plan that Obama supported to cut carbon emissions had stalled in Congress and the carbon tax that Bloomberg supported was going nowhere as well Washington was gridlocked But Pope had explained to Sheekey that shutting down coal plants at the state and local level could do even more for the climateand have a huge impact on public health issues close to his bosss heartThats a good idea Bloomberg told Sheekey Well just give Carl a check for the 50 million Tell him to stop fundraising and get to workBloomberg had never thought of himself as a Sierra Club kind of guy But he saw coal as a killer as well as the main threat to the climate and the Club was in the field doing something about it His only demand was a more analytical approach to the war on coal with measurable deliverables complex predictive models for vulnerable plants and KPIKey Performance Indicators as Pope later learnedThe Sierra Club had never heard of KPI Pope says We just had a gut instinct for what would work The mayor said Oh no no This will be datadrivenOn a sweltering day in July 2011 Bloomberg announced his gift to the Club on a boat he had chartered on the Potomac River in front of a 63yearold coal plant he had always noticed on flights into Washington He saw it as a perfect illustration of the citys inability to get anything doneYoud think the politicians would at least care about the air they breathe themselves Bloomberg marveled to me in a recent interviewThat plant on the Potomac is now closed So is the Massachusetts plant that Mitt Romney once said kills people a line Obama actually used against him in coalstate campaign ads in 2012 So are all of Chicagos plants as Mayor Rahm Emanuel boasted in his first campaign ad in 2015 Overall the 190 plants that US utilities have agreed to retire will eliminate about one fourth of Americas coalfired capacity a total of 79 gigawatts And for every watt of coal capacity theyre taking out of commission theyve already installed a watt of wind or solar capacity The Clean Air Task Force estimate of coalfired premature deaths is down to about 7500 a year a decrease of 5500 since Beyond Coal went national And Bloombergs early support has helped attract more than 100 million from top foundations and wealthy individuals like the Silicon Valley billionaire Tom Steyer the climate movements top political donorIts a reminder that you can do a lot with no help from Congress Bloomberg says I just wish we could point out the specific people who were savedTo coal backers Beyond Coal is pure urban elitist lunacy the kind of nightmare you get when a nannystate mayor from New York hooks up with ecoradicals from San Francisco and a liberal president in Washington Republican Senator James Inhofe of Oklahomachairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee author of The Greatest Hoax thrower of a Senatefloor snowball designed to highlight the folly of globalwarming alarmismtold me its hard to believe some Americans actually want to keep our abundant energy resources in the groundIts a war on all fossil fuels and coal is the No 1 target Inhofe says You got a president who doesnt care how many jobs it costs and rich people who dont care how much money they spend They can do a lot of damageI got to watch the war in Inhofes state and the damage wasnt getting done the way Inhofe imagined The job creators were siding with the environmentalists Economics was the most powerful weapon in the Sierra Clubs arsenalAt a dry hearing in a drab courtroom in Oklahoma City a methodical Beyond Coal attorney named Kristin Henry whose bio identifies her as one of the few environmentalists who would never be caught wearing Birkenstocks was pinning down an Oklahoma Gas  Electric executive with a barrage of wouldntyouagrees isntittrues and woulditbefairtosays The power company was out of compliance with a federal airquality rule called regional haze so it was offering to convert one of its two coal plants into a natural gas plant Henry knew she couldnt stop that But OGE also wanted to install massive new scrubbers on the other plant so it could keep burning coal for decades to come Henry was determined to stop thatIn the 90 minutes Henry spent crossexamining OGEs Joseph Rowlett in early March she didnt ask a single question about climate or public health She focused exclusively on OGEs request for the largest rate increase in state history a 15 percent hike to finance the utilitys 700 million compliance plan Through her deadpan leading questions she portrayed OGE as a company desperate to get its customers to foot the bill to prop up an inefficient plant pursuing retrofits it would never consider if its own shareholders had to swallow the costs operating in a dream world where regional haze was coals only challenge At one point she got Rowlett to admit his calculations assumed there would be no additional coal regulations for the next thirty years even though the EPA intends to finalize at least four new coal regulations this year aloneIsnt it true youre assuming zero over the next 30 years Henry askedThe Sierra Club even though it didnt sound much like the Sierra Club was clearly in hostile political territory Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt a conservative Republican who has spearheaded a national campaign to protect fossil fuels from legal challenges had joined OGE in fighting the EPA haze rule all the way to the Supreme Court Now he was supposed to be representing consumers at the OGE hearing before the Oklahoma Corporation Commission but he hadnt even filed a brief about the record rate hike Thats unheard of one commission official told me Pruitt didnt attend the hearing eitherthe day it began he was in Tulsa with Mike Huckabee raising money for his PACbut one of his deputies who did attend occasionally raised objections when OGE witnesses were asked uncomfortable questionsBut if the political deck seemed stacked against the Sierra Club Henry held the economic cards In Oklahoma coal imported from Wyoming now costs more per kilowatt hour than the abundant gas under the ground or the wind that famously comes sweeping down the plain In another recent haze case the Sierra Club cut a deal requiring Oklahomas other major utility to phase out its only coal plant and buy 200 megawatts of windand the bids came in so low the utility ended up buying 600 megawatts of wind Thats why WalMart the hospital group and the coalition of industrial ratepayers all supported Beyond Coals push for more wind in the OGE case Cheap electricity has a way of scrambling political alliancesHenry and the lawyers for OGEs corporate customers formed a kind of tag team taking turns blasting the company for refusing to even study new wind power They repeatedly pointed out that instate competitors as well as Florida and New Mexico utilities were buying Oklahoma wind for just 2 cents per kilowatt hour even cheaper than coalwithoutpollution controls while OGE hadnt purchased new wind in four yearseven though its ads boasted about its commitment to wind When its witnesses claimed their transmission lines were too congested to add new wind Henry produced internal documents suggesting the congestion could be fixed for about 3 percent of the cost of the new coal scrubbers As she pointed out other Oklahoma utilities have much higher percentages of wind power on their systemsClosing coal plants can sound radical but Henry framed it for the Republican utility commissioners as the conservative response to EPA rules avoiding the risk of stranded investments in outdated plants that might have to be shut down anyway The most economical way to meet haze limits she suggested would be to stop burning the coal that causes the haze Al Armendariz who was Obamas Dallasbased regional EPA administrator and is now Beyond Coals Austinbased regional representative says the Clubs victories in states like Georgia Mississippi and Kentucky have helped normalize the idea of abandoning coal in OklahomaWe get respect because of our track record Armendariz says When we say a utility isnt acting prudently people cant just dismiss us as Oh of course the Sierra Club says that They see how we keep winning They see these big industrial customers agreeing with us Then they look at the numbers and see were rightStill theres no denying the war on coal is leading America into uncharted territory The Sierra Club wants to eliminate all coal power by 2030 but what will replace it Wind and solar despite their rapid Obamaera growth still make up just 5 percent of US power capacity And while technologies to store renewable energy such as Teslas newly announced battery packs are getting cheaper theyre still a rounding error on the grid Beyond Coals leaders are content to push cleaner power and let utilities figure out how to deliver it but as OGE Vice President Paul Renfrow told me Thats easy for them to say We have to keep the lights onInhofe thinks the Sierra Club is simply obsessed with rooting out fossil fuels citing the guy who wants to crucify people as an example of its extremism He meant Armendariz who left the EPA after he was caught on tape suggesting that harsh sanctions for lawbreaking oil and gas companies could scare others into compliance just as public crucifixions helped keep the peace in Roman timesThe Sierra Club wants to stop coal now Inhofe asked Youll see theyll be after gas nextLongterm hes right While the Club accepted some donations from natural gas interests under Pope it is now formally committed to eliminating gas as well as coal by 2030 and it has helped block new gas plants in cities like Austin and Carlsbad California After its victory last week in Asheville Beyond Coal vowed to keep fighting to overturn Duke Energys decision to build a new gas plant to replace its 50yearold coal plant Even Bloomberg thinks the Clubs opposition to the fracking boom that has helped replace so much domestic coal with domestic gas is sillyThat said Beyond Coals leaders including Armendariz understand that Beyond Gas is more aspirational than practical for now They deeply prefer renewables to gas but they almost as deeply prefer gas to coal In Oklahoma City Henry grilled OGE witnesses about why they wanted to spend 500 million on scrubbers for coal boilers that could be retrofitted to burn gas for just 70 million She shredded the implausible assumptions OGE had made in its economic models to make scrubbing coal look cheaper than converting to gas forcing one witness to admit gas prices were already 25 percent lower than his lowcost scenario I sat in on one friendly lunch the Clubs legal team had with lawyers for a Conoco Phillips front group they all hoped to move OGE beyond coal and gas is clearly part of the shortterm solutionWe want to be principled but pragmatic says Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune who stopped the Clubs gasindustry gifts when he took over in 2010 Weve wrestled with this and theres a definite disagreement with Bloomberg We dont see gas as an environmental fix But we acknowledge that we still need some gasCoal is different Bloomberg calls it a dead man walking When he made his initial gift to the Sierra Club the goal was to secure the retirements of one third of the coal fleet by 2015 The Club is only slightly behind schedule and in April Bloomberg came to Washington to announce another 30 million donation with a new goal of retirement announcements for half of the fleet by 2017 Were doubling down on an incredibly successful strategy Bloomberg saidThe campaigns leaders believe coal has already passed a tipping point toward oblivion Coal giants like Alpha Natural Resources Arch Coal and Walter Energy are struggling to stay afloat Just last week in addition to the retirement announcement for the Asheville plantas well as another for a Milwaukee plant that wasnt official enough for Beyond Coal to count as 191the insurance giant AXA announced that it will sell off more than 500 million worth of coal investments the largest financial institution to flee the space to date while the EPA announced it was closing a loophole that allowed virtually unlimited emissions from malfunctioning coal plants a response to yet another Sierra Club lawsuit And the more dirty plants get shut down the more residents near other dirty plants are asking Why not oursIts hard to change the status quo no matter how compelling the economic logic Beyond Coal does not just deploy data It organizes rallies and petitions and floatins on kayaks it shames utility executives on billboards and airplane banners it mobilizes its members to show up at boring hearings where showing up can make a difference If the Oklahoma City case displayed the war on coal as a numerical dispute another hearing I watched south of Detroit was more like a street fightRiver Rouge is a depressed community at the citys edge a blightscape of boardedup bungalows overgrown lots and pawn shops Theres no grocery store and virtually no medical services but there is a nice little park where kids play at the playground and adults fish in the Detroit River Unfortunately the park smells like rotten eggs thanks to sulfur dioxide from a DTE Energy coal plant overlooking the playground Michigan health officials have called this area the epicenter of the states asthma burden The fish arent safe to eat either though people eat themIts just an unhealthy situation says Alisha Winters a local resident and mother of seven children two with asthma They figure they can get away with dumping on usThe EPA has called out this areas elevated sulfur dioxide levels and last year Republican Governor Rick Snyders administration floated a compliance plan that would have required DTE to upgrade the coalfired River Rouge Power Plant or more likely close it But DTE proposed an alternative plan with no costly upgrades and the state quietly accepted it The Sierra Club has been mobilizing opposition ever since drawing an unusual coalition of local whites AfricanAmericans Latinos and ArabAmericansas well as a busload of white liberals from Ann Arborfor an environmental hearing in midMarch The hearing had to be moved from City Hall to a school auditorium to accommodate the groundswell of protests a far cry from that Chicagoarea hearing over a decade ago where the Sierra Club got frozen outWere getting people to cross borders physical and imaginary says Rhonda Anderson a sharecroppers daughter who is now an organizer for Beyond CoalIf the Oklahoma City hearing was financial the River Rouge hearing was political a multiracial show of force in I Love Clean Air Tshirts Every speaker opposed the DTE plan including an IndianAmerican medical student an ArabAmerican law student an AfricanAmerican asthma educator a Latina antipoverty activist and a white nun Ebony Elmore a child care provider who lives a block from the plant talked about her four siblings and three nieces with asthma as well as her two parents with pulmonary disease I happened to ask Democratic Rep Debbie Dingell who was watching the testimony from the side of the hall why she was there just as another resident started telling a story about an 11yearold local girl who died because she couldnt get to her inhaler in timeA few days later Governor Snyderwhose top campaign supporters included one Michael Bloombergannounced a new effort to cut Michigans reliance on coal That would have been a huge political burden for Snyder if he had run for president in a GOP primary where anticoal will be an epithet like antigun or antifreedom but he decided not to run and coal is becoming a huge economic burden for his industrial stateThe already frenetic national pace of plant retirements will have to double for Beyond Coal to meet its 2017 goal but utilities will face daunting investment decisions over the next two years The EPA recently settled a sulfur lawsuit with the Sierra Club that could replicate the River Rouge dilemma across the nation The agency has also imposed regional haze plans that already are replicating the Oklahoma dilemma in Arizona Arkansas and Texas Today Beyond Coal has more than 100 legal cases pending over power supply Meanwhile its pursuing a new strategy on the power demand side pushing blue states like Oregon to stop importing coalfired electricity which could shutter plants in red states like Montana Even inside Texas the Club has worked with relatively progressive cities like Austin San Antonio and El Paso to replace their coal power with renewablesBeyond Coal is also continuing to lobby and litigate in Washington pushing Obama to drop his alloftheabove approach to energy and formally enlist in the war on coal Obama has not been as maniacally anticoal as the industry suggests punting on ozone rules in his first term to avoid alienating voters in Ohio issuing relatively weak restrictions on coal ash taking a lenient approach to mining on public land floating carbon rules with mild targets for the most coalreliant states Still when you add up all hes done and all hes doing you get a tremendously uncertain regulatory environment Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentuckywhose wife Elaine Chao recently quit the Bloomberg Philanthropies board over coalhas urged states to defy the Clean Power Plan but utilities with fiduciary responsibilities dont engage in much civil disobedience They have already shut down dozens of plants to comply with mercury rules the Supreme Court could still strike down and theyre starting to think about carbon tooSome coal advocates still hold out hope that the decline can be reversed if Republicans can win the presidency and keep Congress Weve got a Congress thats sympathetic but weve still got a bureaucracy running amok says Mike Duncan the RNC chairmanturnedcoal advocate That will play in 2016 Obviously anytime you elect a leader its important to this industryIf the EPA stands down under the next president the pace of retirements could slow But it probably wont stop The trends are too strong Nilles recently met with leaders of the utility Southern Company which has slashed its dependence on coal in half over the past five years Its executives rejected his vision of a coalfree America by 2030 but some of them suggested 2050 could be realistic In any case the Sierra Club won a lot of coal fights during the procoal Bush administration because they were ultimately local fights over local airThe fights also have a global context The Earth is already getting hotter and the death of American coal would not avert a climate catastrophe if the rest of the world did not follow our lead But the decline of American coal emissions will help US negotiators insist that other countries do their part in the global negotiations in Paris And while critics of climate action often grumble that it would be foolish for the US to make sacrifices when China is still building a new coal plant every week thats no longer true China actually decreased its coal use last year and is shuttering all four plants in smogshrouded Beijing The trends killing coal in Americacheap gas wind and solar more energy efficiency stricter regulationsare trending abroad as well Cashstrapped US mining firms are desperate to solve their domestic problems by selling more coal in foreign markets but the Sierra Club has helped lead the fight to block six proposed coal export terminals in the Pacific Northwest which will help keep even more coal in the groundThere will be no formal surrender in the war on coal no battleship treaty to mark the end But Beyond Coals leaders believe they can finish most of their work setting the US electric sector on a greener path over the next five years The next phase of the war on carbon would be to try to electrify everything elsecars and trains that use oilderived gasoline and diesel as well as homes and businesses that rely on natural gas and heating oil Nilles hopes power companies like OGE and DTE that Beyond Coal has spent the last decade fighting withbut then cutting deals withcan become allies in Phase Two And allies will be vital because if King Coal seems like a rich and powerful enemy its a pushover compared to Big OilOnce weve taken out coal well need to take on oil and who better to help than our new friends in the utility sector who can make money from electrification Nilles says with a grin Its a long fight This is how we win
