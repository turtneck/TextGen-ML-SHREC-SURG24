WikiLeaks Documents Reveal United Nations Interest In UFOs 11022016 HUFFINGTON POST Revelations in a set of hacked emails released by WikiLeaks earlier this month have sparked new conversations about UFOs and speculation that extraterrestrials have been visiting Earth But a very significant  and possibly overlooked  group of WikiLeaks items relevant to the topic was released on May 18 2015 WikiLeaks posted more than half a million US State Department diplomatic documents from 1978 detailing Americas interactions with countries all around the world  including Grenada Prime Minister Eric Gairys efforts to organize a United Nationsbased committee to research and investigate global UFO reports Many of the documents written by American UN officials indicated how closely they were monitoring Grenadas UFOrelated activities One document  from Nov 18 1978 revealed my involvement in helping Grenada to produce a credible UFO presentation I had an opportunity in early 1978 to meet Gairy in New York to present an idea about how I thought the UN would pay attention to his UFO crusade Through his ambassadors I gave him a copy of a documentary record album UFOs The Credibility Factor that I produced for CBS Inc in 1975 Gairy and I met and after I convinced him I could bring a very credible group of speakers to the UN he agreed to sponsor my proposal see image below Shortly after a handshake deal he made me a temporary delegateadviser of Grenada and the rest was well history COURTESY OF LEE SPEIGEL This 1978 letter from Grenada to Lee Speigel confirmed that countrys commitment to sponsor Speigels UFO presentation at the United Nations The following image shows part of the group I brought together in July 1978 to meet with UN SecretaryGeneral Kurt Waldheim He wanted to know what we were planning to do at our November event in front of the Special Political Committee which included representatives from the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space COURTESY OF LEE SPEIGEL On July 14 1978 producer Lee Speigel now a Huffington Post writer brought together a group of military scientific and psychological experts to meet with United Nations SecretaryGeneral Kurt Waldheim to discuss Speigels upcoming presentation to the UN Special Political Committee later that year Topic The importance of establishing an international UFO committee

Gleisner of the Special Political Committee Lee Speigel researcher Leonard Stringfield and University of Colorado psychologist David Saunders Another cable posted on WikiLeaks  from Nov 24 1978 refers to Ambassador Richard Petrees meeting with Grenada representatives to discuss their UFO resolution Ambassador Petree acknowledged the high level of interest in UFOs among some elements of the private sector and scientific community  and pointed to the budgetary impact as a major concern of the US and other countries On Nov 28 1978 the day after our presentation at the UN this document was sent through official channels detailing the actual UFO event describing what each of the invited scientific and military speakers had to say to the member nations A few days after that on Dec 2 1978 a followup cable was transmitted including the following Subsequent to the introduction of the Grenadian UFO resolution Misoff Mission Officer has engaged in two separate informal negotiating sessions which included representation from Austria USSR and Grenada in an attempt to arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise solution to the problem A draft decision to be taken by the Special Political Committee SPC has been agreed upon by the participants in the informal negotiations subject to concurrence of their respective capitals We think referral of the UFO matter to the Outer Space Committee OSC without a preordained mandate as to what action is to be taken provides the flexibility the OSC needs to take whatever action it deems appropriate It will also obviate the need to vote on a resolution and gamble on the results The following week brought forth another document  on Dec 8 1978 which stated The General Assembly invites interested member states to take appropriate steps to coordinate on a national level scientific research and investigation into extraterrestrial life including unidentified flying objects and to inform the secretarygeneral of the observations research and evaluation of such activities It was further suggested that Grenadas views on UFOs could be discussed in 1979 Unfortunately that didnt come to pass as Grenada Prime Minister Gairy was overthrown in a 1979 coup Needless to say without the Gairybased initiative on UFOs it was quietly relegated to Grenadas back burner This is the tip of the UFOUN iceberg It shows how the subject of UFOs wasnt merely officially ridiculed or slapped aside There was and perhaps still is some interest there just waiting to emerge
