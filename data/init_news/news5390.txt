President Obamas appearance at a town hall meeting Thursday night on Guns in America was an orchestrated performance by invitation only But event hosted by CNN at George Mason University saw anchor Anderson Cooper continually surprise the presidentCooper demonstrated a deft command of the facts related to the gun issue and that came through with his guests and in his questionsthough as the evening unfolded he continually let the president get away with untruths about his past positionsSurprisingly both sides of the issue were present in the small roomthough judging by audience applause most were antigunfreedomSome of the moments were unintentionally revealingCooper began by asking President Obama if hed ever owned a gun Mr Obama sat up in surprise and said no But after a search for words the president said he shoots skeet sometimes at Camp David before adding that hes not much of a marksman When he said that anyone who enjoys the shotgun sports knew he must not have shot skeet much as marksmanship is a term used for target shooting not by those who shoot skeet trap or sporting claysWhen Cooper shifted the discussion to why the president chose to use executive actions on the gun issue instead of working with Congress Cooper asked the president if he would meet with the NRA The president said Im happy to meet with the NRA but as he said it he had this snarky smile on his face that would have been more fitting on one of his late show appearancesNow CNN says they invited President Obama to this live town hall on guns at George Mason University and that they later invited the NRA The NRA however said theyd rather not play along with a public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White HouseThe National Shooting Sports Foundation NSSF the trade association for firearms manufacturers also declined an invitation Larry Keane senior vice president and general counsel to the NSSF told me We declined the invitation because it is a White Houseorchestrated madeforTV event and not an opportunity for a genuine dialogue or an effort to find common ground We remain disappointed that the president has chosen to demagogue the issue for political purposes instead of providing real leadership like working to advance Rep Tim Murphys bipartisan legislation to address the issue of mental health which is the common denominator in mass shootingsGiven Obamasand CNNsattacks on the NRA and gun manufacturers in general it is hard to blame them for passing on the invitation but in retrospect Cooper might have made them wish they were there to help keep President Obama squirmingAs squirm he didwith the facts and in his seatTaya Kyle the wife of the late American Sniper Chris Kyle was the first person Cooper called on Kyle recently won a gun competition using the latest in sniper technology She is a confident straight shooter She pointed out that while the murder rate is at an alltime low gun ownership is at an all time high And then she asked Why not celebrate who we arePresident Obama began shifting on his stool and searching for words to lawyer his way out of these basic facts He finally pointed out that national trends dont necessarily hold true in all locales but he never had to answer why the areas with the strictest gun controls tend to have the highest murder ratesThere was also a rape survivor Kimberly Corban who when called on said I have been unspeakably vandalized once already before asking why she shouldnt be able to carry a gun to protect herselfPresident Obama was really uncomfortable then He began back peddling and said his current executive actions wont interfere with her right to carry a gun But he never had to explain that he has supported bans on concealedcarry permitsPresident Obama also repeatedly said that people can just go on the Internet and buy whatever weapon they want But he was never forced to explain that any gun bought from a dealer over the Internet has to be sent to a local dealer that by law has to perform a background check before they can transfer the gunLater Cooper actually did challenge President Obama by breaking in and asking is it fair to call it a conspiracy that people think he wants to take their guns away Yes it is fair to call it a conspiracy said President Obama who then claimed that he isnt plotting take peoples guns awayBut Cooper didnt force the president to address his advocacy for a renewed assault weapons ban or for his administrations public desire to use black lists such as the nofly list to take away citizens Second Amendment rights without giving them even the basics of due processThere were other questions that took President Obama aback such as when Sheriff Paul Babue pushed Obama on how his proposals wouldnt solve recent mass shootings Cooper even broke in to say that none of the guns used in recent mass shootings I should point out were purchased from legal dealersPresident Obama didnt have a clear answer to say why he isnt swayed by these facts He meandered before saying The young man who killed those children in Newtown didnt have a criminal record but he had access to an arsenal He referred to an attack in China where a person attacked people with a knife and said the vast majority survived because he wasnt wielding a semiautomaticAgain Cooper allowed President Obama to escape an obvious allusion to the fact that he would like to ban semiautomatic firearmsThe president was also allowed to get away with a big lie on smartgunsPresident Obama said Smart Gun technology has not been developed primarily because it has been blocked by the NRA and firearms manufacturersCooper didnt challenge this point and instead called on a person in the audience which changed the topicNevertheless this is a clear and provable fabrication by President Obama As I detail with interviews with many gun makers law makers and gun experts in my book The Future of the Gun the NRA and the NSSF to name two proSecond Amendment groups have statements on their websites saying they are not opposed to smartgun technology All the manufacturers the NRA leadership and more point to laws that seek to mandate smartgun technologyregulations previously backed by the Obama administrationthat are what is impeding smartgun development Even 60 Minutes noted this and pointed out a New Jersey law on the books that would do this in a recent reportPresident Obama said early on in the town hall event that people occupy different realitiesAnyone who watched CNNs Guns in America was certainly left with the conclusion that in Obamas chosen reality he wishes he could with a stroke of his pen pass Europeanstyle gun controls in AmericaFrank Miniter is the author of The Future of the Gun
