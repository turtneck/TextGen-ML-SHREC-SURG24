facilities that left a police officer and two others deadIn contrast all three of the leading Democratic contenders quickly issued statements in support of Planned ParenthoodPresident Obama meanwhile focused on the episode as more impetus for a renewed push to stop the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them Period Enough is enoughNot until much more is known about alleged gunman Robert Lewis Dear Jr and his precise motivations will the political implications of his actions become clear It was suspected according to a law enforcement official that heated rhetoric surrounding the issue of abortion influenced Dears actionsThe setting he chose was one that has developed particular resonance this election cycle after an antiabortion group released a series of secretly filmed videos in which Planned Parenthood officials discuss the techniques and financial aspects of harvesting fetal tissue samples for scientific researchThe videos which Planned Parenthood noted were heavily edited showed the officials talking about gruesome details with clinical detachment Many Republicans have also accused Planned Parenthood of selling such tissue which would be illegal and which the organization vehemently deniesUndercover video shows Planned Parenthood official discussing fetal organs used for researchStopping federal funding of the organization has become a rallying cry of Republican politicians and a battle flag in the larger decadeslong political struggle over abortion rights Democrats have also been vociferous in their defense of the organization which they say is a crucial provider of womens health servicesAs a presidential campaign issue criticism of Planned Parenthood reached a crescendo during the Sept 16 GOP

was accurateFactchecking the second round of GOP debatesFiorina has not said anything publicly about the shootings at the clinic but a campaign spokeswoman noted that she is scheduled to appear on Fox

of asserting that the gunman was motivated by animosity toward the organization and one of the services it offers Sen Bernie Sanders of Vermont however seemed to be edging in that directionWhile we still do not know the shooters motive what is clear is that Planned Parenthood has been the subject of vicious and unsubstantiated statements attacking an organization that provides critical health
