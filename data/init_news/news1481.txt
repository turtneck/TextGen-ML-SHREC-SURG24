This is true at both the national and state levels Modern conservative mythology begins with Reagan a man who tripled the federal budget deficit which shot up to 3 trillion during his tenure and raised taxes 11 times during the course of his presidency Reagan didnt shrink the size of government or grow the middle class On the contrary he made government more bloated more defenseoriented more corporatist George W Bushs 8 years in office were similarly disastrous more corporate welfare more debt more Utopian military campaigns more disorderToday Republican governors are plunging  or have plunged  their states into one abyss after another all under the banner of conservatism There are almost too many examples to cite Sam Brownback in Kansas Bobby Jindal in Louisiana Rick Snyder in Michigan Phil Bryant in Mississippi Scott Walker in Wisconsin Chris Christie in New Jersey Paul LePage in Maine Rick Scott in Florida The list goes on and on and onThe point is obvious enough The conservative brand is taintedNow that Donald Trump has hijacked the Republican Party the conservative intelligentsia is apoplectic Trump isnt a real conservative they say Hes ideologically incoherent they say The assumption is that Trump is an aberration a chimera born of antiestablishment rage Or that hes a threat to the conservative movement rather than its natural outgrowthConsider the latest Wall Street Journal oped by conservative columnist Bret Stephens Stephens writesThere are two problems with this First theres a disconnect between establishment Republicans and conservative voters If you watch Fox News or listen to rightwing radio its clear that the base isnt animated by a coherent worldview Many selfidentify as conservative but their conservatism is a vague stew of cultural resentment religious certainty and halfbaked talking points There is no consistent conservative cause to preserve And if there is a genuine conservative coalition the Know Nothings and the John Birchers are now central to it Indeed the GOP has cultivated these wings since its adoption of the Southern Strategy roughly 50 years agoSecond to the extent that conservative ideas have been implemented in recent years they havent worked The conservative cause is already crippled Neoliberal economics which is what conservative elites support has gutted the country and the working class The trade deals the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans the privatization schemes  have redistributed wealth upwards at the expense of everyone else Conservatives Stephens writes are supposed to believe that its folly to put hope before experience but theyve put ideological dogma over empirical reality for decades Trickledown economics didnt work for Reagan revenue decreased and unemployment spiked to 108 percent after his initial 1981 tax cuts for example and it didnt work for the Bush administrations And yet GOP presidential candidates speak as though the contrary were true as though history doesnt exist One can argue that this isnt classical conservatism that real conservatism involves prudence a pragmatic respect for existing institutions and careful responsiveness to change But thats not what passes as conservatism Todays conservatives are hopelessly wedded to discredited abstractions When elected their ideas have failed Now voters are revolting against the establishment and choosing instead to embrace the ethnonationalism of Trump Stephens writes that A Trump presidency means losing the Republican Party I disagree Trumps nomination means the Republican Party is already lost Or perhaps it was never found The GOP has been ideologically fractured since at least the early 80s when it morphed into a quasireligious movement The Wall Street Journal editorial board cares about tax policy and capital gains but the Republican base doesnt The people voting for Trump are losers in the new economy to be sure but theyre animated by cultural angst and identitybased fears as much as anything else Republicans have exploited their base in similar ways for years Trump has just taken it to another level Im not sure what a Trump presidency really means But its not the death knell for conservatism The GOP ruined conservatism long before Trump If people like Stephens want to save conservatism they need a new party not a new candidate
