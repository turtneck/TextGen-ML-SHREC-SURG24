Its nearing midnight as Steve Bannon pushes past the bluegrass band in his living room and through a crowd of Republican congressmen political operatives and a few stray Duck Dynasty cast members Hes trying to make his way back to the SiriusXM Patriot radio show broadcasting live from a cramped corner of the 14room townhouse he occupies a stones throw from the Supreme Court Its late February the annual Conservative Political Action Conference is in full swing and Bannon as usual is the whirlwind at the center of the actionBannon is the executive chairman of Breitbart News the crusading rightwing populist website thats a lineal descendant of the Drudge Report its late founder Andrew Breitbart spent years apprenticing with Matt Drudge and a haven for people who think Fox News is too polite and restrained Hed spent the day at CPAC among the conservative faithful zipping back and forth between his SiriusXM booth and an unlikely pair of guests he was squiring around Nigel Farage the leader of Britains rightwing UKIP party and Phil Robertson the bandannad ayatollahbearded Duck Dynasty patriarch who was accepting a freespeech award CPAC is a beauty contest for Republican presidential hopefuls But Robertson a novelty adornment invited after AE suspended him for denouncing gays delivered a wild rant about beatniks and sexually transmitted diseases that upstaged them all to Bannons evident delight If theres an explosion or a fire somewhere says Matthew Boyle Breitbarts Washington political editor Steves probably nearby with some matches Afterward everyone piled into party buses and headed for the townhouseBannon an exGoldman Sachs banker is the sort of character who would stand out anywhere but especially in the drab environs of Washington A mileaminute talker who thrums with energy his sentences speed off ahead of him and spin out into great pileups of nouns verbs and grins With his sweptback blond hair and partiality to cargo shorts and flipflops he looks like Jeff Spicoli after a few decades of hard living and he employs dude just as readilyOrdinarily Bannons townhouse is cryptquiet and feels like a museum as its faithfully decorated down to its embroidered silk curtains and painted murals in authentic Lincolnera detail When I first stopped by in January about the only sign that I hadnt teleported back to the 1860s was a picture on the mantle of a smiling woman on a throne with a machine gun in her lap it was Bannons daughter Maureen a West Point grad and lieutenant in the 101st Airborne Division the throne belonged to Saddam Husseinor once did Until Bannon showed up the only sounds I heard were faint noises from the basement which might have been the young women he calls the Valkyries after the war goddesses of Norse mythology who decided soldiers fates in battle More on them laterOn this February night however the party is roaring Along with his CPAC triumph a secret project hed conceived was nearing fruition His lawyers were almost finished vetting a book about Bill and Hillary Clintons murky financial dealings that hes certain will upend the presidential race Dude its going to be epic he tells me I sip my moonshinehis wink at the Dynasty guestsand wonder as people often do whether Bannon is nuts On my way out the doorman hands me a gift a silver hip flask with Breitbart printed above an image of a honey badger the insouciant African predator of YouTube fame whose catchphrase Honey badger dont give a s is the Breitbart mottoBannons life is a succession of Gatsbyish reinventions that made him rich and landed him squarely in the middle of the 2016 presidential race Hes been a naval officer investment banker minor Hollywood player and political impresario When former Disney chief Michael Ovitzs empire was falling to pieces Bannon sat Ovitz down in his living room and delivered the news that he was finished When Sarah Palin was at the height of her fame Bannon was whispering in her ear When Donald Trump decided to blow up the Republican presidential field Bannon encouraged his circuslike visit to the USMexico border John Boehner just quit as House speaker because of the mutinous frenzy Bannon and his confederates whipped up among conservatives Today backed by mysterious investors and a stream of Seinfeld royalties he sits at the nexus of what Hillary Clinton once dubbed the vast rightwing conspiracy where he and his network have done more than anyone else to complicate her presidential ambitionsand they plan to do more But this conspiracy at least under Bannon has mutated into something different from what Clinton described Its as eager to go after establishment Republicans such as Boehner or Jeb Bush as Democrats like ClintonI come from a bluecollar Irish Catholic proKennedy prounion family of Democrats says Bannon by way of explaining his politics I wasnt political until I got into the service and saw how badly Jimmy Carter fed things up I became a huge Reagan admirer Still am But what turned me against the whole establishment was coming back from running companies in Asia in 2008 and seeing that Bush had fed up as badly as Carter The whole country was a disasterAs befits someone with his peripatetic background Bannon is a kind of JekyllandHyde figure in the complicated ecosystem of the righthes two things at once And hes devised a method to influence politics that marries the oldstyle attack journalism of Breitbartcom which helped drive out Boehner with a more sophisticated approach conducted through the nonprofit Government Accountability Institute that builds rigorous factbased indictments against major politicians then partners with mainstream media outlets conservatives typically despise to disseminate those findings to the broadest audience The biggest product of this system is the project Bannon was so excited about at CPAC the bestselling investigative book written by GAIs president Peter Schweizer Clinton Cash The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich Published in May by HarperCollins the book dominated the political landscape for weeks and probably did more to shape public perception of Hillary Clinton than any of the barbs from her Republican detractorsJeb Bush is about to come in for the same treatment On Oct 19 GAI will publish Schweizers ebook Bush Bucks How Public Service and Corporations Helped Make Jeb Rich that examines how Bush enriched himself after leaving the Florida governors mansion in 2007 A copy obtained by Bloomberg Businessweek examines Bushs Florida land deals corporate board sinecures and sevenfigure salary with Lehman Brothers whose 2008 bankruptcy touched off the financial crisis Its not as cinematic as the Clintons with their warlords and Russian gangsters and that whole cast of bad guys says Bannon Bush is more prosaic Its really just grimy lowenergy crony capitalismWhile attacking the favored candidates in both parties at once may seem odd Bannon says hes motivated by the same populist disgust with Washington thats animating candidates from Trump to Bernie Sanders Like both Bannon is having a bigger influence than anyone could have reasonably expected But in the Year of the Outsider its perhaps fitting that a figure like Bannon whom nobody saw coming would roil the national political debateMost days Bannon can be found in his Hyde persona in the Washington offices of Breitbart News Operating from the basement of his townhouseknown to all as the Breitbart EmbassyBreitbarts pirate crew became tribunes of the rising Tea Party movement after Barack Obamas election bedeviling GOP leaders and helping to foment the 2013 government shutdown The site has also made life hell for Democrats by for example orchestrating the careerending genital tweeting misfortune that cost New York Representative Anthony Weiner his seat in Congress in 2011 Tipped to Weiners proclivity for sexting with female admirers Bannon says the site paid trackers to follow his Twitter account 24 hours a day and eventually intercepted a crotch shot Weiner inadvertently made public The ensuing scandal culminated in the surreal scene carried live on television of Andrew Breitbart hijacking Weiners press conference and fielding questions from astonished reportersOn occasion this partisan zeal has led to egregious errors Just before our lunch in January a Breitbart reporter published an article assailing Obamas nominee for attorney general Loretta Lynchbut went after the wrong woman She wasnt as the site reported the Loretta Lynch who was once part of Bill Clintons defense team The embarrassed reporter asked for time off Bannon allergic to any hint of concession refused I told him No In fact youre going to write a story every day this week He shrugs Were honey badgers he explains We dont give a sBut Bannon realizes that politics is sometimes more effective when its subtle So hes nurtured a Dr Jekyll side In 2012 he became founding chairman of GAI a nonpartisan 501c3 research organization staffed with lawyers data scientists and forensic investigators What Peter and I noticed is that its facts not rumors that resonate with the best investigative reporters Bannon says referring to GAIs president Established in Tallahassee to study crony capitalism and governmental malfeasance GAI has collaborated with such mainstream news outlets as Newsweek ABC News and CBSs 60Minutes on stories ranging from insider trading in Congress to credit card fraud among presidential campaigns Its essentially a mining operation for political scoops that now churns out books like Clinton Cash and Bush BucksWhat made Clinton Cash so unexpectedly influential is that mainstream news reporters picked up and often advanced Schweizers many examples of the Clintons apparent conflicts of interest in accepting money from large donors and foreign governments Practically grotesque wrote Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig whos running for the Democratic presidential nomination On any fair reading the pattern of behavior that Schweizer has charged is corruption Just before the books release the New York Times ran a frontpage story about a Canadian mining magnate Frank Giustra who gave tens of millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation and then flew Bill Clinton to Kazakhstan aboard his private jet to dine with the countrys autocratic president Nursultan Nazarbayev Giustra subsequently won lucrative uraniummining rights in the country Giustra denies that the Clinton dinner influenced his Kazakh mining decision The Times piece cited Schweizers stillunpublished book as a source of its reporting puzzling many Times readers and prompting a reaction from the papers ombudswoman Margaret Sullivan who grudgingly concluded that while no ethical standards were breached I still dont like the way it lookedFor Bannon the Clinton Cash uproar validated a personal theory informed by his Goldman Sachs experience about how conservatives can influence the media and why they failed the last time a Clinton was running for the White House In the 1990s he told me conservative media couldnt take down Bill Clinton because most of what they produced was punditry and opinion and they always oversold the conclusion Its clearly impeachable So they wound up talking to themselves in an echo chamber What news conservatives did produce such as David Brocks Troopergate investigation on Paula Jones in the American Spectator was often tainted in the eyes of mainstream editors by its explicit partisan associationIn response Bannon developed two related insights One of the things Goldman teaches you is dont be the first guy through the door because youre going to get all the arrows If its junk bonds let Michael Milken lead the way he says Goldman would never lead in any product Find a business partner His other insight was that the reporters staffing the investigative units of major newspapers arent the liberal ideologues of conservative fever dreams but kindred souls who could be recruited into his larger enterprise What you realize hanging out with investigative reporters is that while they may be personally liberal they dont let that get in the way of a good story he says And if you bring them a real story built on facts theyre fing badasses and theyre fair Recently I met with Brock who renounced conservatism and became an important liberal strategist fundraiser and Clinton ally He founded the liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America and just published a book Killing The Messenger The RightWing Plot to Derail Hillary and Hijack Your Government Brocks attitude toward Bannon isnt enmity toward an ideological opponent as Id expected but rather a curiosity and professional respect for the tradecraft Bannon demonstrated in advancing the Clinton Cash narrative What conservatives learned in the 90s Brock says is that your operation isnt going to succeed if you dont cross the barrier into the mainstream Back then he says conservative reporting had to undergo an elaborate laundering to influence US politics Reporters such as Brock would publish in small magazines and websites then try to get their story planted in the British tabloids and hope a rightleaning US outlet such as the New York Post or the Drudge Report picked it up If it generated enough heat it might break through to a mainstream paperFrom their point of view the Times is the perfect host body for the virusIt seems to me says Brock of Bannon and his team what they were able to do in this deal with the Times is the same strategy but more sophisticated and potentially more effective and damaging because of the reputation of the Times If you were trying to create doubt and qualms about Hillary Clinton among progressives the Times is the place to do it He pauses Looking at it from their point of view the Times is the perfect host body for the virusIt wasnt the only one In June when the Clinton Cash frenzy hit its apex Bannon said Weve got the 15 best investigative reporters at the 15 best newspapers in the country all chasing after Hillary Clinton Theres more coming Bannon reveals including a graphic novel of Clinton Cash in January and a Clinton Cash movie set to arrive in February just as the presidential primary voting gets under wayIn the 90s rightwing activists enjoyed a long period of ascendancy and then collapsed Then as now their prime target was a Clinton their great ally the House Republicans What halted this uprising was the sheer lunacy of its perpetrators The classic example is House Oversight Chairman Dan Burton of Indiana who became convinced that the 1993 suicide of White House Deputy Counsel Vince Foster was actually murdera theory he sought to prove by reenacting the crime in his backyard with a pistol and a watermelon Democrats seized on the episode to impugn his credibility branding him Watermelon Dan We used the watermelon and the phantom Vince Foster sightings again and again says Chris Lehane a Clinton White House staffer and field marshal in the partisan wars of the 90s The phrase didnt exist then but thats when the rightwing conspiracy jumped the sharkBannon believes that episodes like these killed conservatives credibility and with it their political influence Hes set out to balance conservatives wilder impulses with professionalism a running theme in his own life Born into a workingclass family within sight of the naval base in Norfolk Va he signed up straight out of college and spent four years at sea aboard a destroyer first as an auxiliary engineer in the Pacific then as a navigator in the north Arabian Sea during the Iranian hostage crisis By the time he arrived in the Persian Gulf in 1979 the US was preparing its illfated assault on Tehran and Bannons faith in his commander in chief had dimmed You could tell it was going to be a goat f His battle group rotated out just before Carters Desert One debacleBannon became a special assistant to the chief of Naval operations at the Pentagon earning a masters degree in national security studies at Georgetown University at night But he was restless The siren of Reaganera Wall Street capitalism drained the military life of its luster so he resolved to make the leap Somebody told me he says if you want to go to Wall Street you have to go to Harvard Business School HBS accepted him and Bannon at 29 matriculated in 1983Bannons Harvard stint coincided with Wall Streets boom which fueled fantasies among his classmates of the fullon debauched 1980s investmentbanker lifestyle Bannon became a grind made firstyear honors and blanketed the top firms with applications for summer associateships He was universally rejected Classmates told him that his age and Navy background were obstacleshe hadnt come up through the right schoolsOne day a Goldman Sachs representative invited Bannon to a campus recruiting party Thinking he could talk himself into a job he donned a suit and headed over I get there and theres like 700 people jammed into this tent he says I said F it Theres no chance So I stood off on the side with a drink and these two other schmendricks standing next to me And I talk to these guys We have the greatest conversation about baseball and I find out after half an hour it was John Weinberg Jr whose dad runs the firm and a guy named Rob Kaplan who became a senior partner That night the Goldman executives gathered to discuss prospective hires One later recounted the scene They said Well Bannon I guess were gonna reject him Hes too old for a summer job Bannon says And these guys say Oh no we talked to him Hes terrific Literally a complete crapshoot But I got a jobBannon landed in Goldmans New York office at the height of the hostile takeover boom Everything in the Midwest was being raided by Milken he says It was like a firestorm Goldman didnt do hostile takeovers instead specializing in raid defense for companies targeted by the likes of Drexel Burnham and First Boston The first few years he worked every day except Christmas and loved it The camaraderie was amazing It was like being in the Navy in the wardroom of a ship Later he worked on a series of leveraged buyouts including a deal for Calumet Coach that involved Bain Capital and an upandcomer named Mitt RomneyTwo big things were going on at Goldman Sachs in the late 80s The globalization of world capital markets meant that size suddenly mattered Everyone realized that the firm then a private partnership would have to go public Bankers also could see that the GlassSteagall Act separating commercial and investment banking was going to fall setting off a flurry of acquisitions Specialists would command a premium Bannon shipped out to Los Angeles to specialize in media and entertainment A lot of people were coming from outside buying media companies he says There was huge consolidationAfter a few years in 1990 Bannon and a couple of Goldman colleagues set off to launch Bannon  Co a boutique investment bank specializing in media At the time investors preferred hard assetsmanufacturing companies real estateand avoided things like movie studios and film libraries which were harder to price Bannons group drawing on data such as VHS cassette sales and TV ratings devised a model to value intellectual property in the same way as tangible assets We got a ton of business he saysWhen the French bank Crdit Lyonnais a major financier of independent Hollywood studios almost went bankrupt Bannon  Co rolled up its loan portfolio When MGM went bust it worked on the studios financing When Polygram Records got into the film business Bannons firm handled its acquisitionsAnd then serendipitously Bannon wound up in the entertainment business himself Westinghouse Electric a client was looking to unload Castle Rock Entertainment which had a big TV and movie presence including Billy Crystals films Bannon reeled in an eager buyer Ted Turner Turner was going to build this huge studio he says so we were negotiating the deal at the St Regis hotel in New York As often happened with Turner when it came time to actually close the deal Ted was short of cash  Westinghouse just wanted out We told them You ought to take this deal Its a great deal And they go If this is such a great deal why dont you defer some of your cash fee and keep an ownership stake in a package of TV rights In lieu of a full advisers fee the firm accepted a stake in five shows including one in its third season regarded as the runt of the litter Seinfeld We calculated what it would get us if it made it to syndication says Bannon We were wrong by a factor of fiveAfter Socit Gnrale bought Bannon  Co in 1998 Bannon no longer needing a day job dove into Hollywood moguldom becoming an executive producer of movies including Anthony Hopkinss 1999 Oscarnominated Titus He met a hardpartying talent manager named Jeff Kwatinetz who had discovered the band Korn and managed the Backstreet Boys As Bannon was selling his company Kwatinetz was launching one of his own a management outfit called the Firm whose clients included Ice Cube and Martin Lawrence Newly flush and sensing adventure Bannon became a partner and a key player in the Firms great coup its acquisition of former Disney chief Ovitzs company Artists Management Group Ovitz had spent 100 million building a media giant he thought would conquer Hollywood but AMG was bleeding money Selling to the Firm was a lastditch bid to save face Instead as Vanity Fair recounted Bannon was dispatched to Ovitzs Beverly Hills mansion to deliver the final humiliation in person an offer for AMG of 5 million less than the value of Ovitzs homeThe Hollywood ether soon convinced Bannon that his passion wasnt financing films but making them He was souring on Wall Street and what it had come to represent Goldman in the 80s was like a priesthood a monastic experience where you worked all the time but were incredibly dedicated to client services to building and growing companies he says He underwent a conversion like the one Michael Lewis has described watching with horror as staid private partnerships such as Goldman Sachs became highly leveraged publicly traded companies operating like casinos I turned on Wall Street for the same reason everybody else did The American taxpayer was forced to cut mook deals to bail out guys who didnt deserve itBannons political awakening was also spurred by the Sept 11 attacks which led him in 2004 to make a Reaganvenerating documentary In the Face of Evil A brilliant effortextremely well done said Rush Limbaugh This introduced him to Schweizer a Cold War scholar whose book Reagans War was the basis of the film It also brought him into Andrew Breitbarts orbit We screened the film at a festival in Beverly Hills Bannon recalls and out of the crowd comes this like bear whos squeezing me like my heads going to blow up and saying how weve gotta take back the cultureHis films are peppered with footage of lions attacking helpless gazelles seedlings bursting from the ground into glorious bloomBreitbart who also lived in Los Angeles had a profound influence on Bannon When they met Breitbart was starting his website after having worked with Drudge and having helped Arianna Huffington launch the Huffington Post Bannon lent his financial acumen and office space He marveled at Breitbarts visceral feel for the news cycle and his ability to shape coverage through the Drudge Report which is avidly followed by TV producers and news editorsOne of the things I admired about him was that the dirtiest word for him was punditry says Bannon Our visionAndrews visionwas always to build a global centerright populist antiestablishment news site With this in mind he set out to line up investorsBannon continued making documentariesbig crashing opinionated films with Wagner scores and arresting imagery Battle for America 2010 celebrating the Tea Party Generation Zero 2010 examining the roots of the financial meltdown The Undefeated 2011 championing Palin In the Bannon repertoire no metaphor is too direct His films are peppered with footage of lions attacking helpless gazelles seedlings bursting from the ground into glorious bloom Palin for one ate it up and traveled to Iowa trailed by hundreds of reporters to appear with him at a 2011 screening in Pella that the press thought might signal her entrance into the 2012 presidential race No such luck Breitbart came along as promoter and ringmaster When I spoke with him afterward he described Bannon with sincere admiration as the Leni Riefenstahl of the Tea Party movementIn 2010 Breitbart News hit a wall The site published video furnished by a conservative activist of a speech to the NAACP by a Department of Agriculture official named Shirley Sherrod in which she appeared to advocate antiwhite racism Within hours she was fired as the story blanketed cable news It soon became clear that the Breitbart News video was misleadingly editedthat Sherrods point was the opposite of what was portrayed Fox News which aggressively promoted the video banned Andrew Breitbart as an onair guest Bannon who was raising capital for the sites relaunch suddenly encountered nuclear winterBut in a gauge of how media standards have shifted since the 90s the ostracization of Breitbart News didnt last long Less than a year later when the site caught Weiner tweeting pictures of his genitals Andrew Breitbart was welcomed back on Fox News The experience taught Bannon the power of real newsOn the morning of March 1 2012 with the relaunch just days away Andrew Breitbart was walking in his Brentwood neighborhood when he collapsed He died soon after of heart failure at 43 Bannon got the news while in New York pitching investors At the funeral Drudge asked Bannon what he planned to do Were going ahead with the launch he replied Bannon stepped in as executive chairmanBreitbarts genius was that he grasped better than anyone else what the early 20th century press barons understoodthat most readers dont approach the news as a clinical exercise in absorbing facts but experience it viscerally as an ongoing drama with distinct story lines heroes and villains Breitbart excelled at creating these narratives an editorial approach thats lived on When we do an editorial call I dont even bring anything I feel like is only a oneoff story even if itd be the best story on the site says Alex Marlow the sites editor in chief Our whole mindset is looking for these rolling narratives He rattles off the most popular ones which Breitbart News covers intensively from a posture of aggrieved persecution The big ones wont surprise you he says Immigration ISIS race riots and what we call the collapse of traditional values But Id say Hillary Clinton is topsThe website which Breitbart News Network CEO Solov says draws 21 million unique users a month has often managed to inject these narratives into the broader discourse It was Breitbart News for example that first drew attention to the child migrant crisis at the USMexico border last summer that killed any chance of Congress passing immigration reform They have an incredible eye for an important story particular ones that are important to conservatives and Republicans says Senator Jeff Sessions an Alabama Republican Theyve become extraordinarily influential Radio talk show hosts are reading Breitbart every day You can feel it when they interview youLately the site has championed Trumps presidential candidacy helping to coalesce a splinter faction of conservatives irate over Fox News treatment of the Republican frontrunnerTallahassee is about as far as you can get in the US geographically and psychically from the circus of the presidential campaign trail Thats why Bannon chose to locate the Government Accountability Institute therethat and the fact that Schweizer had moved down from Washington Theres nothing to do in Tallahassee so I get a lot more work done Schweizer jokes on my recent visit GAI is housed in a sleepy cul de sac of twostory brick buildings that looks like what youd get if Scarlett OHara designed an office park The unmarked entrance is framed by palmetto trees and sits beneath a large secondstory veranda with sweeping overhead fans where the mostly male staff gathers every afternoon to smoke cigars and brainstormSchweizer began his career as a researcher at the conservative Hoover Institution digging through Soviet archives In 2004 he coauthored a wellregarded history of the Bush family The Bushes Portrait of a Dynasty that drew on interviews with many of its members including Jeb But Schweizer grew disillusioned with Washington and became radicalized against what he perceived to be a bipartisan culture of corruption To me Washington DC is a little bit like professional wrestling he told me When I was growing up in Seattle Id turn on Channel 13 the publicaccess station and watch wrestling At first I thought Man these guys hate each other because theyre beating the crap out of each other But I eventually realized theyre actually business partnersSchweizers interest turned toward exposing this culture and his books became more denunciatory In 2011 he published Throw Them All Out How Politicians and Their Friends Get Rich Off Insider Stock Tips Land Deals and Cronyism That Would Send the Rest of Us to Prison The book caught the attention of 60Minutes and led Congress to pass a law the STOCK Act aimed at curbing the abuses Schweizer documented Bannon encouraged these investigations and eventually offered Schweizer a job He told me I know people who will support this kind of work Schweizer says In 2012 GAI set up shopSchweizer 50 is friendly sandyhaired and a little pudgy the sort of fellow youd meet at a neighborhood barbecue and instantly take a liking to Bannon nurses this regularJoe appeal by forbidding him from wearing a tie when hes on TV Bannon and Schweizer had two principles when they conceived the Clinton Cash project First it would avoid the nuttier conspiracy theories We have a mantra says Bannon Facts get shares opinions get shrugs Second they would heed the lesson Bannon learned at Goldman specialize Hillary Clintons story they believed was too sprawling and familiar to tackle in its entirety So theyd focus only on the last decade the least familiar period and especially on the millions of dollars flowing into the Clinton Foundation Bannon calls this approach periodicityAs with many of the Clintons troubles the couples own behavior provided copious material for investigators When Clinton became secretary of state the foundation signed an agreement with the White House to disclose all of its contributors It didnt follow through So GAI researchers plumbed tax filings flight logs and foreign government documents to turn up what the foundation withheld Their most effective method was mining the socalled Deep Web the 97 percent or so of information on the Internet that isnt indexed for search engines such as Google and therefore is difficult to findWelcome to The Matrix says Tony GAIs data scientist as he maps out the Deep Web for me on a whiteboard we agreed I wouldnt publish his last name A presentation on the hidden recesses of the Web follows The Deep Web he explains consists of a lot of useless or depreciated information stuff in foreign languages and so on But a whole bunch of it is very useful if you can find it Tony specializes in finding the good stuff which he does by writing software protocols that spider through the Deep Web Since this requires heavy computing power Tony struck a deal to use the services of a large European provider during offpeak hours Weve got 13 billion of equipment Im using at almost full capacity he says This effort yielded a slew of unreported foundation donors who appear to have benefited financially from their relationship with the Clintons including the uranium mining executives cited by the New York Times who showed up on an unindexed Canadian government website These donations illustrate a pattern of commingling private money and government policy that disturbed even many DemocratsClinton Cash caused a stir not just because of these revelations but because of how they arrived GAI is set up more like a Hollywood movie studio than a think tank The creative mind through which all its research flows and is disseminated belongs to a beaming young Floridian named Wynton Hall a celebrity ghostwriter whos penned 18 books six of them New York Times bestsellers including Trumps Time to Get Tough Halls job is to transform dry thinktank research into vivid viralready political dramas that can be unleashed on a set schedule like summer blockbusters We work very long and hard to build a narrative storyboarding it out months in advance he says Im big on this Were not going public until we have something so tantalizing that any editor at a serious publication would be an idiot to pass it up and give a competitor the scoop To this end Hall peppers his colleagues with slogans so familiar around the office that theyre known by their abbreviations ABBN  always be breaking news he says Another slogan is depth beats speed Timestrapped reporters squeezed for copy will gratefully accept original factbased research because most of what theyre inundated with is garbage The modern economics of the newsroom dont support big investigative reporting staffs says Bannon You wouldnt get a Watergate a Pentagon Papers today because nobody can afford to let a reporter spend seven months on a story We can Were working as a support functionThe reason GAI does this is because its the secret to how conservatives can hack the mainstream media Hall has distilled this too into a slogan Anchor left pivot right It means that weaponizing a story onto the front page of the New York Times the Left is infinitely more valuable than publishing it on Breitbartcom We dont look at the mainstream media as enemies because we dont want our work to be trapped in the conservative ecosystem says Hall We live and die by the media Every time were launching a book Ill build a battle map that literally breaks down by category every headline were going to place every oped Peters going to publish Some of it is a wish list But it usually gets doneOnce that work has permeated the mainstreamonce its found a host body in David Brocks phrasethen comes the pivot Heroes and villains emerge and become grist for a juicy Breitbart News narrative With Clinton Cash we never really broke a story says Bannon but you go to Breitbartcom and weve got 20 things were linking to everybody elses stuff were aggregating well pull stuff from the Left Its a rolling phenomenon Huge traffic Everybodys investedWeve got 13 billion of equipment Im using at almost full capacityOver the summer Hillary Clinton failed to emerge as the overwhelming frontrunner everyone expected Shes been weighed down by the Clinton Foundation buckraking and the revelation that she kept a private email server as secretary of state and destroyed much of her correspondence Recently the scandals have merged In August emails surfaced showing that Bill Clinton through the foundation sought State Department permission to accept speaking fees in such repressive countries as North Korea and the Congo A poll the same day found that the word voters associate most with his wife is liar On Oct 22 Hillary Clinton will testify on these matters before the Select Committee on Benghazi Her troubles arent going awayVeteran Democrats such as Lehane concede that Bannon and his ilk have been more effective than conservatives who targeted Bill Clinton 25 years ago Theyve adapted into a higher species he says Theres more on the way Weve got two more waves of stuff on Clinton corruption says Bannon including a focus on how the donors highlighted in Clinton Cash violated many of the principles liberals hold dear You look at what theyve done in the Colombian rain forest look at the arms merchants the warlords the human traffickingif you take anything that the Left professes to be a cornerstone value the Clintons have basically played them for fools Theyve enriched themselves while playing up the worst cast of characters in the worldWhile this is surely unwelcome news for Clinton Lehane argues that where the Clintons are concerned their opponents invariably become consumed by partisan zeal and undermine their own cause Remember the old Pink Panther movies when Clouseau would walk in and the chief inspector would be there and hed just start losing his marbles no matter what he says Thats how these guys areBannon does indeed have a touch of Clinton Madness When we met in January Bill Cosbys serial predations had just exploded into the news after laying dormant for many years Bannon was certain this signaled trouble for Bill Clinton whose own sexual history some conservatives long to revive as a way of hampering his wifes campaign His conviction stems from the group of young female Breitbart News reporters whom hes dubbed the Valkyries When I expressed skepticism about the value of reintroducing old scandals Bannon countered that the Valkyriesa sort of inhouse focus group of millennial voter sentimentwere unfamiliar with Clinton contretemps that most older people consider settled Theres a whole generation of people who love the news but were 7 or 8 years old when this happened and have no earthly idea about the Clinton sex stuff he saysIts impossible to predict how Bannons plots and intrigues will ultimately affect the presidential race Its not even clear on whose behalf hes actinghis own or someone elses Are Seinfeld royalties enough to take on Clinton and Bush Or do others have a stake Solov the CEO wont say I cant go into that he says Its privately owned Bannon wouldnt comment either However a prominent conservative says Robert Mercer the reclusive cofounder of hedge fund Renaissance Technologies and a major donor to Texas Senator Ted Cruz has invested 10 million Mercers daughter Rebekah is listed in 2013 tax documents as a GAI board memberEven without knowing the identity of his backers Bannons designs are clear enough While hed blanch at the comparison hes pursuing something like the old Marxist dialectical concept of heightening the contradictions only rather than foment revolution among the proletariat hes trying to disillusion Clintons and Bushs natural base of support recognizing as Goldman Sachs taught him that youre more effective if others lead the wayTo succeed Bannon will need to activate the anger and disgust with cronyism thats as powerful among supporters of Sanders as it is among fans of Trump In Tallahassee as GAIs phone keeps ringing the vehicle for achieving this is clear Editors and reporters at prominent magazines and newspapers including ones that had passed when approached with Clinton Cash revelations are calling to ask when the next salvo will arriveand might they arrange an exclusiveFor many the answer will be yes Were going to go to the investigative units not the political reporters and just give them the stuff says Bannon We have faith theyll take the stories and do the additional reporting The thought pleases him and he grins Just like last time well go out and say Hey heres what weve got You guys take it from hereUpdate Oct 13 An earlier version of this story stated that James OKeefe supplied the videotape of Shirley Sherrod He did not
