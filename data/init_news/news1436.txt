It is 2007 and I am an undergraduate at the University of Tehran Im very particular I take notes with Staedtler Triplus Fineliner pens in purple and green and on this particular day Ive run through the stash I keep in my desk at home There is a small office supply store next to the university cafeteria Ive bought my pens there before Before lunch I go to pick up some more FinelinersWere out says Farid the young Kurdish boy who works in the store The supplier says there wont be anymore at allWhy not I askThey say because of sanctions but Im not sure he saysSanctions What the heck do pens have to do with sanctions I ask surprisedEight years later things are a little clearer In 2007 we were just entering what would become a period of intense deprivation brought on by evertightening UN Security Council sanctions It would become the worst disruption of Iranian life since the IranIraq War of my childhoodNow what seems like a lifetime later a nuclear agreement has been signed between Iran and theP51 We have been promised an end to the chokehold a brighter future for Iran Well seeThose of us born after the revolution have lived our whole lives under sanctions Following the November 1979 takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran the United States imposed its first round of sanctions against Iran Except for a brief period from 1981 to 1984 they have never been lifted In March 1995 President Bill Clinton signed an executive order significantly expanding the scale of the embargo preventing US companies from doing business with IranBut as difficult as these restrictions made the 90s life was still far easier than in the decade before  the Iran of my childhoodWhen I was a child long lines for basic goods were routine Throughout the IranIraq War 1980 to 1988 my parents bought everything from bread to cheese to meat using coupons Even items like paper erasers or womens nylon socks were often difficult to come by When my parents married and moved into their first home in the early 1980s basic household appliances were virtually impossible to find as the combination of sanctions and war had brought both imports and domestic production to a halt To get a refrigerator my parents submitted their marriage contract to the neighborhood mosque which took these contracts and tried to find necessary household supplies for new couples living in the neighborhood I was born a few years laterI was 4 years old before we had a phone When I was 5 we finally bought furniture  a table and two chairs Throughout the war we heard news of young boys perishing on the front lines entire families wiped out by bombs For a while street bombings became frequent in our neighborhood and when my father left home in the morning my mother remained fearful till nightfall uncertain if he would returnI was 4 years old before we had a phone When I was 5 we finally bought furniture  a table and two chairsBut by the time I was a university student the war was long over Though sanctions persisted Iranians had found loopholes and alternative means of getting what they needed The worst of the deprivation was past My classmates and I knew the hard life we remembered it but it had become a story a tale for nights when we gathered around a dinner table we didnt struggle to findI wouldnt realize it until years later but 911 was the day that a decadelong Iranian upswing began to fall apart Despite the absence of Iranian involvement in the attack the West steadily ramped up our isolation When a secret uranium enrichment plant was discovered in Natanz in 2002 the isolation intensified We were placed on George W Bushs Axis of Evil and then surrounded as the United States invaded Afghanistan to our east and Iraq to our west In 2005 the conservative exmayor of Tehran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad defeated reformers in a presidential election and the worlds disdain came even harderIt was difficult enough to deal with the changes he wrought at home The university security staff we had been accustomed to  many of them young boys from the provinces  were replaced by sternlooking guards wed never met The cafeteria where we had always sat down together to eat was gendersegregated by a long blue curtain We heard of professors being forced into retirement and unknowns close to the administration taking up positions they were not fit for academicallyAs students it never felt as if Ahmadinejad represented us but neither did we feel any affinity for the United States It was Ahmadinejad who had brought a new security staff to our university But it was America that had placed us under siege We knew our nations shortcomings but in many years of cafeteria debates my peers and I could never justify how wed been singled out why the world seemed to simply not like us We began to think of ourselves as the unpeopled never seen by the outside world but living as we always hadIf anything it seemed to us at the time that Ahmadinejad and Bush were similar  both in language and deed seemed to damage the prestige of their people in the eyes of the world Yet the American presidents embarrassing behavior did not seal off his entire country from food and medicine We paid Ahmadinejad no heed but the international condemnation of Iran grew louder At first we tried to focus on school on grades love art and life but it was difficult Some analysts claimed then and still claim now that the sanctions weakened Iranian support for the state but that was never the whole story It never felt true for my friends and me If anything we began to echo the state Why the double standard for IranThen our lives came to a halt In 2006 our government refused to continue implementing parts of the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty significantly reducing the inspection rights of International Atomic Energy Agency personnel in Iran In December of that year  then again in March 2007 October 2007 and March 2008  the United Nations Security Council retaliated by intensifying sanctionsThese new embargoes effectively closed the loopholes that had allowed Iranians to get by over the past 10 years We were no longer able to purchase goods we could access easily before Flights to Iran by international carriers were reduced or stopped entirely Magazines that had survived against all odds were once again threatened by paper costs they could not afford Iranian oil exports accounted for between 60 and 80 percent of the countrys revenue  suddenly both Europe and the United States refused to buyThe university security staff we had been accustomed to  many of them young boys from the provinces  were replaced by sternlooking guards wed never metWithin our borders strange men with almost no credible administrative experience tightened their grip on all sectors the economy the cultural space even the heritage organization a government body responsible for preserving historical sites The reactionary policies of the Ahmadinejad administration coupled with the new severe sanctions began to cripple usThe impact of the sanctions on academia alone has been devastating All manner of vital technical equipment became scarce while universities across the country were not permitted to renew their subscriptions to search repositories  even in the fields of medicine and the humanities Coursera a platform that offers free open online courses has become inaccessible within our borders Our previous ability to conduct research and contribute to world scholarship was brought to a painful standstillWhile a portion of University of Tehran graduates typically remained in Iran to work the new sanctions provoked a mass exodus Almost no one chooses to stay after undergraduate studies Doors seem to close all around us Within months of my first disappointment in the stationery store every writing and drawing tool I used disappeared off the market for goodThe impact of sanctions outside my academic bubble is far worse Vitamins have become hard to find My mothers supplements disappeared off the market as did tampons and foreignmade baby formulas We went to drugstore after drugstore across the city but were told the same thing everywhere The item you want is no longer being imported due to sanctions My grandfathers Germanmade eye drops vanished The Iranian ones hurt his eyesMore critically vital cancer medication has become excessively difficult to get ahold of Between 2011 and 2014 while visiting sick relatives I met patient after patient in the hospital whose condition had become critical due to delayed treatmentWhat they expect me to sell my house to buy medication And then what will the family be left with if I die anyway asked a tall silverhaired man I met one day He had just started chemotherapy months later than he should have He died within weeksAlmost like a joke cancer rates appear to have climbed as well Some doctors blame new lowquality domestic gasoline While Tehran has always suffered from air pollution weve begun to witness unprecedented levels  sometimes looking over the graygreen haze that covers the city it becomes impossible to breatheIranian banks are cut off from SWIFT Society for Worldwide Interbank Telecommunications effectively cutting off financial communication between Iran and other countries The private sector has been hit badly The textile and automobile industries have been especially affected with many plants completely shutting down entirely Across industries obtaining spare parts or requesting maintenance for machines has become extremely expensive in some cases impossible Two of Irans main nonpetroleum exports handmade carpets and pistachios have started piling up in basementsAll of this has sent the economy into free fall The new sanctions led to unprecedented inflation as high as 40 percent according to some estimates which in turn caused a sudden spike in the price of basic commodities like milk and vegetable oil Some crucial goods are available only on the black market and there is no way  official or otherwise  to know how bad inflation has gotten therePerhaps you can imagine the 2008 American financial crisis to get a sense of what it was like  peoples financial holdings falling apart within days years of careful savings wiped out My parents spent the first decade of their marriage in a war zone and the next 15 years trying to build on lost time making up for all those years of deprivation Within the span of months almost nothing remained of that effort My mothers clients went out of business my fathers academic and industrial research has been severely disruptedPerhaps you can imagine the 2008 American financial crisis to get a sense of what it was like  peoples financial holdings falling apart within daysOver dinner we talk about wartime What it was like to live on rations How life was lived with so little We remember fondly our capacity for contentment how we were all in it togetherThis time it does not feel a group struggle Under the sanctions those who are savvy enough and amoral enough exploit others deprivation for a profit They function as middlemen and brokers preying on the needs and envies of citizens These men become wealthy but at the cost of ordinary people turning against one another moral and social life coming apart During the war I could never have told my father to get me the same doll my classmate had  each of us already had or didnt have the same things But under sanctions I have seen my uncles lambasted by their children because they didnt pay the brokers for some flashy new toy their classmate gotIn 2013 President Hassan Rouhani was elected with a mandate to stop this vicious cycle to bring sanity and sustenance back to Iran Despite monumental obstacles inside and outside of Iran he has so far managed to deliverOn July 142015 adeal was announced between Iran and six world powers including the United States We were told that in exchange for a curtailment of our nuclear program and ongoing rigorous inspections the sanctions would finally be liftedI saw my grandfather that night He lived through the occupation of his province during World War II through the revolution the war and the sanctions years When we discussed the news he smiled looking out into the distance He read a poem We are but leaves dancing to a windOn the night of the agreement I drive the streets of Tehran trying to feel what the city felt Valiasr is known as the longest street in the Middle East  it traverses the city from north to south Long sycamore trees once ran the length of the road but now they only grow in Northern Valiasr one of Tehrans most affluent neighborhoods This is where the crowds gather the celebrations bringing traffic to a standstill People are out of their cars playing music the sound of their whistles and applause rising above the trees in the darkWe see luxury cars everywhere more in one place than Ive ever witnessed in Tehran before Lexus Mercedes BMWs But between them are the motorcycles of young boys who have come up from the working class neighborhoods of southern Tehran They are easy to spot among the crowd They wear stained Tshirts probably smudged from a long day at work and fake Nike shoes As we drive south the yelling screaming and happy crowds give way to the dead of nightI have now lived three decades I was born after a revolution in the midst of a war I have seen stability I have seen chaos I have seen bloodshed I have seen calm and all that lies between Despite the agreement we do not look forward to an uncomplicated era of plenty Even if all goes according to plan the legacy of sanctions cannot be erased An economist I know from the University of Tehran put it this way Sanctioning a country like this is similar to permanently disabling a human being You might stop inflicting harm but the damage is there foreverI wonder if this is true All that we are promised by this deal  more stability a financial recovery more open political and social space  we have had and lost before Who can guarantee it wont be lost again Those of us who have seen the sinusoidal pains and recoveries of these past three decades know that much depends on the whims of a world far from our jurisdiction or oversight We cannot make it bend but it will bend us For many Iranians the end of sanctions is nothing more than the end of another chapter in a colossal
