While the nuclear arms accord with Iran is being hailed as a historic agreement it should be regarded as only one piece of an increasingly complex patchwork of foreign policy challenges presented by Iran and its network of allies As a result of this deal Iran stands to reap a potential windfall ofbillions of dollarsthat has been held up by international sanctions designed to cripple the Iranian economy and bring Tehran to the negotiating tableEven if most of this money is channeled to Irans domestic economy the bounty will nevertheless help resuscitate the Iran threat networka nefarious web of insurgent criminal and terrorist alliesand revitalize Iranian meddling worldwide Iranian sponsorship of terrorist organizations cannot be divorced from the negotiations because the sanctions that will be lifted provide new sources of funding to reinforce the Iran threat networkThe fact that the nuclear agreement does not address the threat network means that Iran remains a serious threat to stability in the Middle EastFormed in the 1980s theIran threat networkhas expanded from a ragtag militia to an enterprise with global reachand operatives who are active in dozens of countries Over the last three decades Iranian largesse has provided the Shiite group Hezbollah with hundreds of millions of dollars training weapons and modern equipmentThe network now includes proxiesin YemenandIraq where the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps and its elite Quds Force are training sectarian militias Also of concern are Iranian accomplices including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon andmore recently Syria Hamas has increasingly relied on financial support from Iran since the Syrian civil war began in 2011In addition to Irans growing battle with Saudi Arabia for regional hegemony the mullahs that comprise the core leadership of Iranand are considered the vanguard of the Islamic Revolutionhave also pushed to develop afairly sophisticated cyberwar capability The SaudiIranian rivalry is playing out through the sponsorship of proxies in Yemen and SyriaOver the past several years Iran has devoted more resources to cyber warfare perhaps in response to a destructive software attackreportedly initiated by the United States and Israelthat effectively targeted Iranian nuclearenrichment equipment The Iranians have already penetrated American and Saudi networks and successfully seized and destroyed sensitive dataGoing forward US policy toward Iran must reflect thenuanced nature of the relationship While the nuclear agreement is a positive step toward resolving the most serious potential threat posed by the Islamic Republic the Iranian regime is still amajor sponsor of terrorist groupsopposed to the United States and its key allies throughout the Middle East North Africa and the Persian Gulf regionDesigning and implementing a global strategy to address the Iran threat network is essential to stability in the Gulf and will require the exercise of American power to deter Iran while reassuring allies in the region and wider world Even though the United States welcomes Irans help combating ISIS Washington must keep pressuring Tehran to cease its support for terrorist and insurgent groups in Gaza Lebanon and YemenThe United States and its allies must continue to combat the financing of terrorism by working through the Treasury Department and collaborating with privatesector entities to identify and then take action against Iranian funding of terrorist groups The United States also should keep trying to build partner capacity in atrisk nations like Lebanon and Yementhus depriving Iran of the political legitimacy afforded external state sponsors of terrorismwhile working to build a force in the region capable of providing at least a modicum of stability Finally the United States must continue to closely monitor Iranian behavior to ensure that relief from sanctions does not allow Iran the flexibility to exacerbate conflicts in already fragile nations throughout the Middle EastAfter pausing to celebrate the Iran nuclear deal as a move in a new direction the Obama administration should capitalize on it to gain the momentum needed to contain the regional and global ambitions of the Iran threat networkColin P Clarke is an associate political scientist at the nonprofit nonpartisan RAND Corporation and the author of Terrorism Inc The Financing of Terrorism Insurgency and Irregular Warfare 2015
