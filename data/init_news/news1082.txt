Why You Should Stop Apologizing for Doing All That You Can Illustration by Kim Ryu By Kelly Hayes  transformativespacesorg Ive noticed lately that lot of allies and accomplices I talk to about NoDAPL and other struggles will name what they are trying to contribute to the cause and then promptly apologize that they cant do more Often the apologies seem perfunctory or even insincere but sometimes they seem quite heartfelt Personally I deal with enough ideological tourists and movement loitering to feel a little sad when good people are doing good things and feeling shitty about themselves anyway Maybe they dont realize how many people applaud themselves for standing on the right side of history as though reading an article or a book and figuring out where to stand is how one affects the course of history Or perhaps they just dont know how to appreciate themselves  or have even been taught not to So I just want to say to everyone  whether you see yourself as an ally accomplice or frontline struggler If you are really doing all that you can you have nothing to apologize for Because if you are really and truly doing all that you can youre actually setting a pretty high standard for the rest of us And if you are really and truly doing all that you can you should appreciate that about yourself and allow yourself to be appreciated by others Because as simple as it may sound its often hard for us to internalize the fact that on the scale of what we can all contribute all you can is actually everything If youre accustomed to selling yourself short that may seem a little grandiose so lets vision this through for a moment Can you imagine how much closer to free we could get if everyone really did all that they could  within their own capacity without martyring themselves in a heap of burnout What would it look like What could we build I think some of us have seen snapshots of what that could look like in moments of consuming fastpaced community collaboration where we had to take care of each other to sustain community and the work But those breakneck sprints of action and inspiration and the communitycare triage that they necessitate are not a model for daytoday living Because that intensity burns out A broad sustainable vision  and a simple one really  of community where everyone who claims to care passionately about a thing simply does all they can and does their best thats obviously a dream thats still under construction When we think about what obstacles impede that dream we might first think of the internal failings of individuals apathy selfishness etc But what informs these tendencies Is it possible that we are taught that some contributions are too small to matter and that some are so great that theyll make all the difference Are we caught in a mythology where we are deemed either heroic or insignificant The idea that heroic individuals somehow marshal their talents and resources hello Batman to liberate the masses has to put it mildly an oppressive functionality If internalized it has the potential to shorten our social and political reach due to our own self obsession In movement building we learn that heroic communities rather than heroic individuals propel our freedom dreams Such communities are made up of people of all capacities who bravely and lovingly do all they can Respecting our differing capacities is part of taking care of each other and personally I want to live in world where we honor each others contributions celebrate one another and love and care for each other So the bottom line here is Be glad to acknowledge that you do all you can Lets not teach others who might take an interest in movement work that feelings of insufficiency and guilt are the inevitable consequences of those efforts We can be humble without erasing or diminishing ourselves We can tell people what it means to us to do what we can and we can discuss the different shapes that can take  and how fulfilling it can be If youre reading this and thing to yourself Well I really could do a lot more you could be right I dont know your story or who depends on you what your health is like or what resources you have to give But if you think you have more to offer dont approach those efforts from a place of guilt  because as you may have noticed the guilt of the privileged has never gotten anyone free So take joy in sharing your efforts and ideas with others Celebrate what it means to be a resistor acting in defense of your community or acting in solidarity with others And if youre a white accomplice appreciate what it means to be a fullfledged traitor to white supremacy Because thats a beautiful thing and worth smiling about Im not saying we should gloss over the messes we make and wade through in our organizing spaces As communities we need to be real about the rough places movement work can go  especially when discussing the structural oppressions we replicate in our own spaces But we also need to feel right about the things we deserve to feel right about and to remind each other of that If your goal is to be enough to put right everything thats wrong you will never be enough But if your goal is to build a culture and a community that upends its oppressions then the best youve got  the best that a whole lot of us have got  is exactly what its going to take Its easy to tell people not to burn out but I think it sometimes helps to think of movements as larger forces of nature  as constellations of actions movements stories and freedom fighters There are all kinds of actiontakers who show us what the pursuit of freedom looks like So just do your best today and do it again tomorrow and feel right about that Because together we will get there 00
