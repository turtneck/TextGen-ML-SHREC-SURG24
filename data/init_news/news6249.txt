Donald Trump is a proud man He rarely admits thathes wrong He even said at one point in this campaign A lot of times when you apologize they use it as ammunition against youBut Donald Trump effectively apologized twice on Friday  or at least admitted he was wrong twice And arguably he did itthree and even four timesFirst on Friday morning there was Trumps admission that he mistook video of the release of US hostages held by Iran in Geneva as video of a transfer of 400 million from the United States to Iran Then on Friday night he endorsed House Speaker Paul DRyans RWis reelection after declining to do so just threedays priorOh and he also endorsed Sens John McCain RAriz and Kelly Ayotte RNH whom he also conspicuously declined to back earlier this weekWe will have disagreements but we will disagree as friends and never stop working together toward victory  and very importantly toward real change Trump said of Ryan in Green Bay WisThe endorsement followed plenty ofuncertainty In commentsto The Washington Posts Philip Rucker on Tuesday Trump declined to back Ryan and said nice things about Ryansprimary opponent Paul Nehlen The snub was particularly notable since Ryan delayed his own endorsement of Trump But given that endorsement eventually arrived Trumps lack of reciprocation was seen as a political faux pas  or perhaps a signal to Ryan that his continued criticism of Trumps controversial comments wasnt appreciatedTrump also thumbed his nose at Ayotte citing her lack of direct supportYou have a Kelly Ayotte who doesnt want to talk about Trump but Im beating her in the polls by a lot Trump told Rucker You tell me Are these people that should be representing us okay You tell meIn the end though it looks like a GOP nominee who often says things he might regret had cometo regret these comments Trump trails in the presidential race badly in recent polls  by as much as 15 points  and the potential for the GOP establishment to desert him was just not something he could take onRyan has set himself up as the conscience of the GOP He withheld his endorsement of Trump for a long time before coming around and he has regularly weighed in when the establishment saw Trump going too farBut whats most notable here is that Ryan continued his criticism of Trump even after Trump threatened to withhold his endorsementWe just came out our convention and yeah heshad a pretty strange run since the convention Ryan told Jerry Bader ofWisconsin local radio station WTAQin an interview Thursday You would think you ought tobe focusing on Hillary Clinton  on all of her deficiencies She is such a weak candidate that one would think wed be on offense against Hillary Clinton and it is distressing that thats not what were talking about these daysRyan reassured that his support wasnt a blank check and even sent a fundraising email that could be read to warn of a potential landslide Trump loss in NovemberIf Trump wanted Ryan to kiss the ring and back down he didnt get it But despite that he felt the pressure to back the most significant figure in the GOP establishment And in doing so he also bowed to the pressure he faced to endorse two senators who would be very important to GOP efforts to hold onto the SenateWere past the point where things like this can be cast as Trump truly changing tack and shifting into general election mode But clearly this was one case in whichhe bowed to the kind of political reality he usually shrugs at
