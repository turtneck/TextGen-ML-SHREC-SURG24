Most of the headlines from Sen Elizabeth Warrens speech at the American Constitution Society on Thursday were understandably about her attacks on Donald TrumpHighlighting Warrens rapid succession of fusillades against Trump makes sense After all outside of this election you dont often get sitting US senators publicly calling the other partys presidential nominee a racist bully who has never risked anything for anyone and who serves no one but himselfBut Warrens speech did much more than go after Trump In her highprofile address she pivoted from attacking the likely GOP nominee to attacking Republicans more generally accusing the partys leaders of orchestrating a prolonged assault on the independence of the federal judiciary in order to serve the wealthiest AmericansFor instance when Warren highlighted Trumps racist attacks againstJudge Gonzalo Curiel she said they were born from the same essential motivation as other mainstream Republican initiatives like the blockade of Merrick Garlands Supreme Court nomination and the Citizens United decision on campaign finance to help the richest of the richDonald Trump chose racism as his weapon Warren said But his aim is exactly the same as the rest of the Republicans to pound the courts into submission for the rich and the powerfulNow it should be noted that many leading Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have condemned Trumps remarks about Curiel So it doesnt seem entirely fair to blame them for what Trump has said thereBut the line does give us insight into how one of the leading progressives sees Trump and it suggests how a Warrenled Democratic Party might respond in 2016 and beyondMany Democrats have said that Trumps rhetoric against Curiel amounts to proof that hes uniquely unfit for the presidency as a sign that he goes far beyond even what other Republicans are willing to sayWarren didnt take this approach Over and over she insisted that Trumps comments about Curiel reflect the Republican attacks on the courts  the only difference being that theyre done with less tactWhere do you suppose that Donald Trump got the idea that he can personally attack judges regardless of the law whenever they dont bend to the whims of billionaires and big businesses Hes a Mitch McConnell kind of candidate  He is exactly the kind of candidate youd expect from a Republican Party whose script for several years has been to execute a fullscale assault on the integrity of our courts blockading judicial appointments so Donald Trump can fill them Smearing and intimidating nominees who do not pledge allegiance to the financial interests of the rich and powerful Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell want Donald Trump to appoint the next generation of judges They want those judges to tilt the law in favor of big businesses and billionaires like Donald Trump They just want Donald Trump to quit being so vulgar and obvious about itWarren connected Trumps attacks on Curiel to Republican obstructionism against the judicial branch going back years citing their unwillingness to confirm appointees like District of Maryland nominee Paula XinisShe began the speech for instance by citing her Senate offices new report Going to Extremes The Supreme Court and Senate Republicans Unprecedented Record of Obstruction of President Obamas Nominees And she said wealthy corporations have flooded the political system with cash in an attempt to corrupt the judiciaryThe purpose is also to hamstring the presidents ability to protect consumers and workers to hold large corporations accountable and promote equality Warren said In other words to undermine the fundamental principle of equal justice under lawIt seems pretty questionable whether obstructing federal judicial appointments is really comparable to Trumps attacks against a judges heritageBut whether you buy Warrens interpretation or not as a partisan political strategy it has distinct pros and consOn the one hand attacking Trump by calling him a mainstream Republican is probably not going to be particularly devastating to Trump himselfHillary Clintons best shot at a landslide victory might be peeling away centrist Republicans turned off by Trump If thats the case comparing Trumps most outlandish attacks to the policy decisions of the partys leaders may not prove particularly convincingOn the other hand though it could help Democrats in their effort to ensure that its not just Trump who goes down to defeat but rather the Republican Party as a whole
