The mass shooting in Orlando Florida Sunday exposed the two presumptive major party nominees  Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton  to a penetrating examination of their characters and political instincts at a moment of crisisThe worst terror attack on American soil since 911 has become a test of leadership as they vie for the worlds most powerful job and a chance to scramble for political advantage in the general election campaignTheres an accepted playbook for politicians to respond to tragedies wrought by terrorism It involves not rushing to conclusions but promising to punish the perpetrators Often a flurry of new plans to combat terrorism is produced And leaders generally mourn the dead avoid stigmatizing the entire Muslim community and invoke lofty ideals of national unity rather than partisan politicsIn doing so they emulate the unifying instincts shown by past commanders in chief at moments of extreme national grief and fear President George W Bush in an iconic display after 911 stood on a pile of rubble at Ground Zero to vow vengeance against al Qaeda but also visited a Muslim community centerIn the shocking hours following Sundays attack on an LGBT nightclub by a gunman apparently inspired by ISIS Clinton largely chose to follow this triedandtested rulebook with a few departures from the script for her own political benefitTrump however tore it to shreds demonstrating once again the extent to which he represents a radical departure from established political norms thrilling his supporters and alarming his foesThe real estate developer went out of his way to play politics with the tragedy with fearsome attacks on Clinton and President Barack Obama within hours of the rampage and a blistering speech Monday that appeared to equate all Muslims with the homegrown radicals behind recent terror attacksHe presented himself as a candidate of change urgency  and the antidote to the status quo exemplified by Clinton That conventional approach he charged allowed terror to fester and he accused the former secretary of state of wanting to take away Americans guns and let radical Muslim immigrants slaughter innocentsAnd in one of his first tweets after the killing spree Sunday he called on Obama to resign if hes not willing to use the words radical Islamic terrorismWe need a new leader We need a new leader fast Trump said at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire on Monday They have put political correctness above common sense above your safety and above all else I refuse to be politically correctHe added The days of deadly ignorance will end and they will end soon if Im electedIf he does win the election Trumps actions over the last two days suggest that not only will Americas posture in the global war on terror change significantly but the entire mold of how the US president responds to tragedies and national crises could also be shatteredClinton has responded the Orlando attack in a more conventional way  but that too represents a political overture even if a subtler oneShe sought to neutralize the potency of Trumps attacks over her language by telling CNNs New Day Monday that she was willing to use the term radical IslamismAnd the horror unfolded two weeks after she lacerated Trumps temperament worldview and knowledge which she said disqualified him from being Americas commander in chiefSo its a natural extension of her campaign strategy to build upon that argument through the aftermath of the latest terror strike on US soilOn Monday she took Trumps arguments about increased scrutiny of the Muslim community and his calls for tough new immigration policies and argued they would make America less safeInflammatory antiMuslim rhetoric and threatening to ban the families and friends of Muslim Americans as well as millions of Muslim business people and tourists from entering our country hurts the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror she saidSo does saying that we have to start special surveillance on our fellow Americans because of their religion she continued Thats wrong And its also dangerous It plays right into the terrorists handsTrump however has been undeterred by this argumentHes instead provided tough talk about Muslims and terrorists speaking with declarative directness about crushing terrorism in a way some voters might find more satisfying than the cliches uttered by political leaders ever since the September 11 attacksIndeed tough talk on terror is a cause behind which many Republicans even those who are skeptical of Trump can unite and offers at least the prospect of Obamas rising approval numbers which are currently above 50 and thereforehelpful to ClintonTrump offered a frank admission after ISISinspired massacres in France and San Bernardino California last year that acts of terrorism and his strong response help his poll numbersBut he also risks alienating voters not enamored of sweeping statements that can be untruthfulHe seemed to suggest Monday that every Muslim immigrant was potentially a savage terrorist He said the perpetrator of the Orlando attacks was an Afghan even though he was an American born in New York And he made unsubstantiated claims that Clinton is looking to confiscate all Americans guns and wants to let loose Islamic terroristsVoters sizing up Trump as a potential president might also note that he tends to tear open political divides rather than to build bridges at a time of crisis And in the aftermath of the tragedy Trump appeared to be preoccupied that the media was not treating him fairly according to one of his Facebook posts in which he explained that he was rescinding the press credentials of The Washington PostEverything Clinton has done since the attack seems to have had the ulterior motive of setting up an implied contrast with Trump to exploit this possible vulnerabilityWhere Trump was impulsive in his brash Twitter response to the attack Clinton was moderate Her initial tweet and statements avoided overt politicization of the tragedy and she left it to her communications director Jennifer Palmieri to fire back at Trump in a volley that quickly turned the tragedy into a political war of wordsClinton like her rival was framed by American flags for her speech responding to the massacre but in comparison she spoke deliberately and unveiled a detailed plan to combat the evolving scourge of homegrown terrorismThough she chose not to mention Trump by name her speech was a clear repudiation of the policies the Republican espoused a few hours laterThe Orlando terrorist may be dead but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive And we must attack it with clear eyes steady hands unwavering determination and pride in our country and our values Clinton saidWhile she proposed an effort to root out terrorism in the Middle East and at home she stressed unlike Trump that Muslims must be part of the processShe also didnt hesitate to jump into the fray on the key Democratic issue of gun control calling for more efforts by the US government to stop weapons of war from getting into the hands of radicalized AmericansAnd she reached out to a core political support base  the LGBT community  expressing empathy for the attack on a place where those who died had imagined they were safe and among friends who understood themOverall Clinton sought to portray herself as the kind of sober unifying figure dedicated to considered action and meticulous planning that many Americans expect to see in their presidentYet the risk for her in part is being seen as a figure of continuity at a time when many Americans are becoming increasingly fearful for their security and could begin to blame the Obama administration for the new instances of terror on its watchObama for all his rhetorical gifts has come under criticism in recent months for not adequately communicating with an American public reeling from multiple attacks on the WestHis analytical reserved nodrama style could hardly be more different than that of the pyrotechnical Trump  one reason why the Republican presumptive nominee has drawn millions of supportersClinton while more hawkish in her rhetoric than Obama would be a far more conventional national security president than Trump partly owing to experience on the international stage as a former first lady and secretary of stateSo far its not clear if the wider general electorate will prefer the outspoken billionaires brand of antiterror politics or gravitate to Clintons more sober personaBut each candidate is betting in the wake of the worst mass shooting on US soil that they have best responded to the national mood
