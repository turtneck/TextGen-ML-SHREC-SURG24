Will shake things up Media ratings magnet  Likely to steal all the thunder Since Trumps June 2015 announcement speech every word or phrase listed above describes what the American electorate witnessed or felt during the campaign because as I said Trumps consistency has been uncanny Now lets now examine three quotes from the speech and then refer back to the list All three reinforce the premise in my headline But it was the following statement that haunted Trumps campaign from the second the words left his mouth When Mexico sends its people theyre not sending their best Theyre not sending you Theyre not sending you Theyre sending people that have lots of problems and theyre bringing those problems with us Theyre bringing drugs theyre bringing crime theyre rapists and some I assume are good people Watching Trump say that on live television I immediately thought There goes the Hispanic vote The fact is demographic voter data shows that for a Republican to be elected president he or she must win at least 47 of the national Hispanic vote Then poof in one 20second rant Trump destroyed all the Republican Partys Hispanic outreach rendered since Romney won only 27 of the Hispanic vote in 2012 From the impression list Trumps inartful Mexican statement branded him with lacks a political filter and lacks presidential demeanor to put it mildly These two major negative branding phrases may have begun with his muchmaligned Mexican comments but later applied to numerous Trumpisms which popped up over the last year slowly undermining and unraveling his chances of ever winning 270 electoral votes Next is a Trump foreign policy gem about terrorism Islamic terrorism is eating large portions of the Mideast Theyve become rich Im in competition with them What the  does that mean Lets go to the impression list where we apply incoherent inarticulate uninformed and desperately in need of a speech writer  to name just a few And once again repeat after me Aall we need to know we learned For my last selection I chose an example of how Trump right out of the starting gate tried to antagonize and denigrate other Republican presidential candidates and later highranking party leaders It is important to note that Trump made the following statement within the first minute of his announcement speech The other candidates  they went in they didnt know the air conditioning didnt work They sweated like dogs They didnt know the room was too big because they didnt have anybody there How are they gonna beat ISIS I dont think its gonna happen Yikes That nonsensical statement exploded the impression list It was the opening act of an obstinate candidate who we found out too late is totally resistant to change even after his campaign began its slowmotion meltdown Sadly Trumps announcement speech stands as living proof that he flunked kindergarten etiquette Circling back to Flughums theory during his campaign Trump never learned to clean up his own mess and has never said he was sorry after hurting someone or a group of someones In the end Trumps likely defeat will be written off as an historical fluke He will be viewed as a charismatic untested onetime outsider candidate who spearheaded a successful movement of fedup voters Through his celebrity status he managed to parlay mass frustration into winning the Republican presidential nomination but along the way neglected to learn the basics of kindergartenlevel political behavior The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily represent or reflect the views of the editors Crossposted at RedState
