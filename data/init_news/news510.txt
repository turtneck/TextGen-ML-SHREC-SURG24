And the Wisconsin Republican isnt talking about moving legislation in CongressLong before Ryan clutched the speakers gavel bow hunting deer consumed his latefall and earlywinter weekends Ryan aims to bag three or four deer a year He then crafts jerky and sausage from the meatRyan has held the speakers job since late October And so far so good in the legislative sausage factory Passage of major education and transportation bills A tax relief package The forging of a bipartisan pact to avoid a government shutdownRyan even challenged Republican Presidential frontrunner Donald Trump  without mentioning the candidate by name This came after Trump suggested the US should ban Muslims from entering the countryWhat was proposed yesterday is not what this party stands for and more importantly its not what this country stands for said Ryan after Trumps proposal a few weeks agoRyan appears to have altered the course on Capitol Hill  at least for a timeIm very happy with how the last seven weeks have gone he declaredBut the sausage of late hasnt been the political stuff Otto von Bismarck spoke of when describing the onerous legislative processNext year is when Ryans real sausagecuring experiment is put to the test  merging political pork veal beef and venison with intestines salt spices and breadcrumbsThe barn left to Ryan by former House Speaker Rep John Boehner ROhio is now formally cleanAnything from here on is Ryans barn Passing the annual spending bills Dealing with the Obama administration Deciding what to do about the Benghazi committee A decision on a threat by House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep Jason Chaffetz RUtah to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen Wrangling over the Asian trade pact Confronting the threat of terrorism Chasms in the GOP Internecine fighting over the 2016 race for presidentRight now most political observers are trained on the campaign for president But Ryan is campaigning too Not for president at least not yet But a campaign to calm the House return to the illustrative but elusive regular order and instill confidence in the public and lawmakersBut 2015 was marked by exceptional turmoil within the GOP ranks calls for Boehners head and his eventual resignation an aborted campaign for speaker by Majority Leader California GOP Rep Kevin McCarthy squabbling over funding the Department of Homeland Security and raising the debt ceiling vexed Congress this yearRyan wants 2016 to go differentlyAlready there are catcalls from the farright that Ryan is the same as Boehner Or maybe worse than Boehner Or that he already sold out In the new year Paul Ryan will face the conservative wing of the GOP Theres no more saying he came into the play during the second act or that Boehner is still on the hookThere will always be contrarian voices out there Ryan said Members of the conservative movement know me as one of their ownHe hopes to hand the biggest legislative keys to the House Appropriations Committee and rankandfile members as they try to fund the government next yearThis involves plowing through the 12 annual spending bills to run each section of the government and avert a crisis next September They had better get rollingCongress is scheduled to be out of session for a staggering seven weeks stretching from July through early September to accommodate the Democratic and Republican parties conventionsThat doesnt leave much time to wrap things up by September 30 2016 the end of the governments fiscal yearWhen asked how and why things seem easier than under the tenure of his predecessor Ryan momentarily ponders the questionIm not sure I can give you a good answer on that he finally repliesHowever he made clear that his goal is to loosen control Perhaps without realizing it Ryan responds to the Boehner regime interrogatory saying this place used to predetermine everything down to the amendmentRyan believes he can empower members to influence policy through the appropriations process They can do so by prescribing how much or how little money the federal government devotes to a given program That invests everyone in the enterpriseOf course that means Republicans wont get a lot of things they want and demand from Ryan And Democrats sure wont eitherRyan got a taste of working with Democrats on the recent pact to fund the government and renew major tax breaks at the end of the yearI didnt really know these people he said of the Democrats pointing out that he talked to Senate Minority Leader Sen Harry Reid Nevada once for about 30 seconds in 2012He says he and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi DCalif never had a conversation before the omnibus spending talksThats to say nothing of negotiating with President ObamaObama wants to dine with the new GOP speaker sometime in the new year Ryans spoken with the president by phone on multiple occasions since claiming the gavelStill Ryan described the administrations approach to governing as arrogant paternalistic and condescendingEven if Ryans able to get along with Obama and congressional Democrats  to say nothing of members of his own party the presidential sweepstakes will dominate 2016 And what happens if one particular candidate polls well as they approach the Republican convention in ClevelandI put up with politics in order to do policy he saysBut theres lots of GOP handwringing about whether Republicans can hold the Senate and maybe maybe the House if the party nominates TrumpI think were going to have a good climate Ryan says optimistically of the GOPBut theres already chatter about what happens if the party is torn and Trump is cruising toward victory at the Cleveland nominating conventionWhat does the GOP do Some private Republican conversations involve a brokered convention Maybe the party pulls a Steve Harvey and switches the nominee at the last minute One line of thought is for the GOP to engineer a brokered convention that perhaps propels someone like Ryan to the nominationHes the only person who can unify the Republican party opined one senior Republican House member and possibly beat Hillary ClintonRyan publicly eschews that sort of talk Of course he also didnt like talk about him running for speaker Until he didSome political observers point to the video Ryan released before Congress abandoned Washington for Christmas Titled A Confident America the slicklyproduced creativelyshot tape mimics a campaign commercial  if not a movie trailerIt crescendos with dramatic music and inspirational oratory liberally swiping segments from a speech Ryan delivered a few weeks ago in the Great Hall of the Library of CongressWe believe in the American idea Ryan proclaims We stand for a more prosperous a more secure and a more confident AmericaNote that Ryan is one of few major GOP political figures who has been willing to take on TrumpBut for now theres sausage to be made  in Washington and in WisconsinRyan knows what to do with the venison back home And in 2016 well see how he does in the Capitol Hill smokehouse
