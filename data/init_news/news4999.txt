Donald Trumps sweeping victoriesTuesday nightmove the Manhattan billionaire a step closer to winning the Republican nomination for president and to pulling off the most improbable political feat in modern American history But Trumps story is about more than a firsttime candidates stunning rise It is also about the humiliating defeat suffered by an increasingly isolated political and media class who still do not understand the causes and scope of Trumps populist revoltIn his book Coming Apart The State of White America 19602010 Charles Murray wrote about the rise of a new American upper class and the narrow elites who shape Americas economy culture and government The number of players who dominate the direction of media politics and finance is surprisingly concentrated for a country as sprawling and diverse as the United States And yet almost all of these influencers across Manhattan and Washington were incapable of blunting Trumps meteoric rise Time and again over the past year Washington insiders and media moguls misread the mood of workingclass voters and their attraction to the populist message championed by TrumpOn Tuesday that message which undermines Republican orthodoxy on trade taxes and immigration resonated with GOP primary voters so strongly that Trump cruised to lopsided victories in Pennsylvania Connecticut Rhode Island Delaware and MarylandSo why did these narrow elitesmiss the mark so badly when the topic turned to Trump Because most of themare hopelessly isolated from the other 300 million or so Americans who inconveniently share their countryMurray writes that most members of the narrow elite dont watch much television If they watch any news programs it is probably the PBS NewsHour or Morning Joe Powerful influencers have also watched other television shows over the past decade like Mad Men House of Cards Breaking Bad Game of Thrones and Curb Your Enthusiasm While such critically acclaimed shows are often consumed by narrow elites in frantic fits of binge watching the other 300 million Americans view television a bit differentlyMurray reports that the average American watches about 35 hours of television a week Since 2004 Trump has starred in 14 seasons of The Apprentice And if youre a member of the narrow elite that holds sway over media coverage or government policy chances are good that you saw few episodes of The Apprentice or SurvivorBut millions of Americans did and perhaps that kind of mass consumption is why Trump will beat Don Draper at the polls every timeHistory may not repeat itself but it does rhyme when the topic turns to TV careers and Republican politicians From 1956 to 1962 Ronald Reagan hosted General Electric Theater and had his image beamed into more than20 million homes every week The successful run on TV gave Reagan a connection with American voters that his movie career never could By the time Reagan ran for governor of California in 1966 the GE host was a household name Reagans landslide victory shocked elites in and out of the political class and launched a conservative revolution that would last a generation50 years later that revolution is being undone by another TV star who has been underestimated by elites while being elevated by workingclass voters The question now is whether Trump can prove his critics wrong again by winning the nomination and then defeating Hillary Clinton in the fall The odds may be long for the New York developer and reality star but no longer than the ones he faced last June when he first sought the GOP nomination
