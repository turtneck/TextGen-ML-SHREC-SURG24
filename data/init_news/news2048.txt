Say what you will about Donald Trump but the man is winner Trump didnt just wallop his opponents Tuesday  he crushed them Up 41 percent in Delaware 40 percent in Rhode Island 37 percent in Pennsylvania 33 percent in Maryland 30 percent in Connecticut hes estimated to have won 110 delegates versus five for Kasich and three for CruzIf the race for the GOP nomination were a Little League game the mercy rule would be imposedHeres where we stand today Ted Cruz is mathematically eliminated from winning the Republican nomination before the convention in Cleveland John Kasich has now won a single state  Ohio  where he is governor If ever there were a series of states that would at least theoretically be fertile territory for him it would be the Northeast home of the last vestiges of Republican moderates Yet he didnt crack 30 percent anywhere Republicans can talk all they want about Never Trump and trying to stop him at the RNC in Cleveland They can talk about changing the rules and holding out hope that a white knight candidate will emerge It isnt going to happen Either Trump is the nominee or hell burn the whole thing to the ground If youre a gambler go all in on the formerIt is worth stepping back however and noting that Trumps hammerlock over the party  and his ascendancy within the GOP  is astounding Hes a political amateur who never held elected office hes a xenophobe a bully and a misogynist and he has run directly against the leadership of the party he hopes to lead Yet today he stands on the cusp of winning the nomination of the party of Lincoln Eisenhower Nixon and Reagan I know weve all become inured to Trumps insults his knownothingness and his crudeness but it cant be said enough  truly we are living in a political moment unlike anything that any of us has seen beforeHeres what might be even more amazing Trumps position as the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party is not the most remarkable political event this year Rather its that the Democratic Party is poised to nominate the first woman to be a major party candidate for president Somehow this constantly seems to be forgotten and whether you like Hillary Clinton or despise her that America is poised to nominate a woman for president is a big dealTuesday night Clinton racked up four more primary wins including the delegaterich states of Maryland and Pennsylvania Only in Rhode Island did Bernie Sanders thwart her Early on in the evening before all the races had been called he gave a victory speech in West Virginia that not only left unmentioned the evenings results but plowed forward with confidence about the road ahead Its a fitting metaphor for the Sanders campaign which increasingly seems to operate in a realm completely divorced from reality Sanders cannot and will not win the Democratic nomination PeriodIndeed in her victory speech Clinton  as she has increasingly done  simply ignored Sanders Instead she aimed her daggers at her real target Donald Trump The Democratic race will continue but for all intents and purposes it is over Clinton can now begin her pivot to the general election and Sanders can play out the stringWhat we now with some certainty is that were only a few months away from an historic unprecedented presidential campaign  and no matter which candidate wins on Election Day history will be made
