Posted on November 1 2016 by Dr Eowyn  2 Comments For Hillary Clinton and her accomplice and protector the Obama administration Russia is the new allpurpose bogeyman They say the Russian government is the hacker of those revealing and embarrassing DNC Hillary and Podesta emails that WikiLeaks has been releasing Hillary even accused Donald Trump of being in cahoots with Moscow The latest accuser is longtime Democratic strategist James Carville As reported by Edund Kozak for PoliZette  in an appearance on MSNBC yesterday Oct 31 2016 Carville attacked the FBI for reopening its criminal investigation into Hillary Clintons emails calling it part of a vast conspiracy to subvert American democracy See  Weinered FBI reopens investigation into Hillary Clintons emails  Carville raged This is in effect an attempt to hijack an election Its unprecedented  the House Republicans and the KGB are trying to influence our democracy FBI Director James Comey was acting in concert and coordination with the House Republicans We also have the extraordinary case of the KGB being involved in this race and selectively leaking things from the Clinton campaign that they hacked As noted by Kozak Apparently the fact that the Soviet security agency KGB was disbanded in 1991 does not preclude its involvement in this vast antiClinton FBIorganized conspiracy Now the New York Times reports via ZeroHedge  that in an investigation into Russias possible involvement in the 2016 presidential election the FBI concludes that theres no evidence that Trump is connected with the Russian government For much of the summer the FBI pursued a widening investigation into a Russian role in the American presidential campaign Agents scrutinized advisers close to Donald J Trump looked for financial connections with Russian financial figures searched for those involved in hacking the computers of Democrats and even chased a lead  which they ultimately came to doubt  about a possible secret channel of email communication from the Trump Organization to a Russian bank Law enforcement officials say that none of the investigations so far have found any link between Mr Trump and the Russian government And even the hacking into Democratic emails FBI and intelligence officials now believe was aimed at disrupting the presidential election rather than electing Mr Trump Hey James Carville you conniving POS This message is for you Eowyn
