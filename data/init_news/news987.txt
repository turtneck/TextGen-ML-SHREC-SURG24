Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio both rising in the polls staged their own spirited debate on immigration and national security in Tuesdays Republican presidential debateMarco Rubio left and Ted Cruz right both speak as Ben Carson second from left and Donald Trump second from right look on during the CNN Republican presidential debate at the Venetian Hotel  Casino on Dec 15 2015 in Las VegasIn the final Republican presidential debate of 2015 no subplot mattered more than the growing feud between Sens Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of FloridaSenator Cruz surging in the polls is an antiGOPestablishment outsider  like frontrunner Donald Trump  but with stronger conservative bona fides than Mr Trump and significant appeal among evangelicalsSenator Rubio now polling third nationally represents a kinder gentler face of Republicanism one with a more collegial relationship with fellow senators than Cruz and more potential to attract swing voters in the general electionWith Trumps national lead continuing to grow to the chagrin of party leaders the battle to become the main alternative to Trump is more pitched than ever as the kickoff Iowa caucuses on Feb 1 draw closerBut the battle didnt play out Tuesday night in attacks on Trump Indeed Cruz and Rubio both went easy on the flamboyant billionaire in a likely effort to woo his supporters should they cool to his unorthodox campaign persona and style Instead the two CubanAmerican senators went after each other in Las Vegas on national security and immigration the evenings dominant themes in the wake of terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino Calif Heres how those exchanges played outNSA phone record surveillance Rubio has been going after Cruz lately over his vote for the USA Freedom Act which imposed new limits on the collection of phone metadata by US intelligence agencies in an effort to protect civil libertiesI promise you the next time there is attack on  an attack on this country the first thing people are going to want to know is why didnt we know about it and why didnt we stop it Rubio said Tuesday And the answer better not be because we didnt have access to records or information that would have allowed us to identify these killers before they attackedCruz defended the legislation as expanding the potential universe of records the government has access to What he didnt say is that the government now must get a court order to access them which defenders say does not represent a serious hurdleDefense spending and approach to Islamic State Rubio also went after Cruz for voting multiple times against legislation that authorizes defense spendingYou cant carpet bomb ISIS if you dont have planes and bombs to attack them with Rubio charged referring to the socalled Islamic State They cannot be defeated through air forcesCruz has promised to carpet bomb ISIS with air strikes and is less enamored of sending US ground troops to Syria and Iraq than is Rubio In the debate he defended his no votes against the defense authorization act as fulfillment of a promise to oppose the federal governments authority to detain US citizens without due processCruz also tried to lash Rubio to the policies of President Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the frontrunner for the Democratic nominationWe need to focus on killing the bad guys not getting stuck in Middle Eastern civil wars Cruz saidImmigration For Rubio this issue is the most fraught as it gives some conservatives pause over his candidacy As a new senator he coauthored comprehensive immigration reform legislation only to renounce the bill  which included a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrantsRubio has sought to paint Cruz as favoring legalization of the undocumented over his support for big increases in the caps on green cards and the number of visas for hightech workers Cruz has since backed off that position and in the debate he fought backI led the fight against Rubios legalization and amnesty Cruz said adding that to suggest our records the same is like suggesting the fireman and the arsonist have the same record because they are both at the scene of the fireIn debate postmortems both senators were deemed to have had strong performances and their duel is likely to intensify in the weeks aheadThat Cruz and Rubio are both CubanAmerican firstterm senators in their mid40s may be an accident of history but it matters to a Republican Party anxious to showcase diversity Whether either could make major inroads into the Hispanic vote is an open question particularly for Cruz who doesnt speak Spanish and who only uses his heritage to highlight his Cubanborn fathers journey to freedom in the USRubio on the other hand is fluent in Spanish and has made his Cubanimmigrant parents humble lives as serviceworkers a central part of his optimistic view of the American dreamIf any of the Republican candidates are capable of channeling Ronald Reagan whose sunny demeanor helped him to the presidency twice it may be Rubio Likability is a key ingredient to presidential campaign success and if support for Trump begins to wane one cant assume that his voters go to CruzToo often Cruzs message seems negative and I think thats a challenge for him says Henry Barbour Republican national committeeman from Mississippi speaking before Tuesdays debate The key is to come across as the guy with the positive agenda  the Ronald Reagan of the group And everybody wants to be the Ronald Reagan
