The official candidates  Rand Paul Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz  gathered at Nashua New Hampshires Crowne Plaza hotel this Friday and Saturday for the First in the Nation Republican Leadership SummitThe summit also featured unofficial candidates who are almost certainly running but cant quite say so yet for legalfundraising reasons Scott Walker Chris Christie Jeb Bush Bobby Jindal Rick Perry Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee to name a few You also had your forpretend candidates like Donald Trump and Lindsey GrahamBeneath them are the YOLO candidates like former Virginia Gov Jim Gilmore former New York Gov George Pataki and former UN ambassador John Bolton All here Former Maryland Gov Bob Ehrlich occupies whatever tier is beneath Gilmore and Pataki and he was here too At the very bottom of the pile isthis guy HereNew Hampshire Republicans are not the same as Iowa Republicans Theyre blunt and talk fast and are in no way intimidated to ask a governor or senator or ambassador whatevers on their mind in a shrewd distrustingwhats your angle heresort of way Theres a libertarian bent to the states conservative politics and by and large no one wants to waste any precious time talking about say gay marriageThis is not to say that the conservative diehards in New Hampshire dont have their own quirks The ones in attendance at the FITN summit at least care alotabout ISIS establishing beachheads on the continent and the scourge of illegals If you were wondering last fall why New Hampshire GOP Senate candidate Scott Brown kept going on about ISIS fighters crossing the southern border to infect Americans with Ebola a few conversations at the Crowne Plaza in Nashua would make it quite clear Theres a paranoid style to New Hampshire politicsHes trying to destroy the country a woman in blackandwhite shoes and a Diane Keatonstyle tievest combination whispered to me during the speech from former UN Ambassador John Bolton She was referring to the current Democratic president  or Democrat president in the parlance of rightwing conferences Bolton had just said that the principle responsibility of the President of the United States is to protect the country and for this woman and presumably everyone else in the room Barack Obama has performed poorly on that scoreBizarrely enough Im more familiar with Boltons talking points than any other candidates and the man presents a terrifying view of the world Everyone is trying to bomb us and our president wont bomb them and Bolton cant stand this and hes going to make America care about his particular brand of foreign policy and not all these wishywashy foofoo issues like education or health care ISIS is coming for us Russia is coming for us China you name it And oh this Iran deal The most serious act of appeasement in American history Bolton likes to close with a dose of levity about how he has a special understanding of Hillary Clinton since he was a year apart from Bill and Hillary at Yale Law School Hillary was a radical then and shes a radical now According to Bolton the way people are in graduate school is pretty much the way they are the rest of their lives and Hillary Clinton is every bit the leftist that Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama are Scared yetI read an article in the Investors Business Daily that scared the crap out of me an older man began his question to Bolton Turns out ISIS is setting up training camps in New Mexico or maybe its MexicoMexico and theyre pouring across the border The article in questioncites a report from Judicial Watch a rightwing paranoiac crank website saying ISIS has spotters in New Mexico to aid in deadly terrorist crossings This news didnt surprise John Bolton at all John Bolton is never surprised John Bolton has seen some thingsIve been reading some things about ISIL another older man says Hes been reading the Internet and you just wont believe the stuff hes finding ISIS is trying to establish a Caliphate and according to the Koran once the Caliphate is established all Muslims are required to pledge allegiance to it and kill all nonparticipants Why arent we stopping Islam John Bolton is of course aware of this and not surprised by it and to him the fact that Barack Obamawont even name the enemygives the enemy enormous powerBut these two questioners were warmup acts for the Greatest Question Ever It came from the woman sitting next to me the same one who had whispered to me earlier that Obama is trying to destroy the country She didnt mean this metaphorically She had evidence  proof so ironclad that it could only have come from a weird multicolorfont chain email that old people forward to each otherWhat do you think about the War on Terror within She asks Obama has been filling the government with Muslims He is filling the State Department with the Muslim Brotherhood It gets worse This woman has also heard that Barack Obama is amassing tanks and artillery weapons to stage a revolution in the streets He may have several four and fivestar generals who are going along with this And then theres theThe answer is no John Bolton cut her off laughing nervously She had managed to surprise John Bolton and thats an accomplishmentWell youre probably nicer to me than the conservative media Mike Huckabee told me after I was introduced to him as a reporter from a liberal news outletI had been watching him on Fox News from the hotel lounge announcing that he announce his presidential decision in early MayRight after the segment aired Mike Huckabee walked through the lounge on his way to something else Like a moron I pointed at the TV and said to him YOU WERE JUST ON THE TV as though bewildered that someone can climb out of a television set and into real lifeCantsay Ive ever been very nice to Mike Huckabeebut its true that hes about to go to war with conservative mediaSmallgovernment fiscal conservatives have never liked Huckabee For all outspoken social conservatism and a foreign policy informed by fundamentalist interpretation of Revelation hes never been much of a budgetcutter Hell claim that a lot of this had to do with the Democratic legislature he dealt with when he was governor of Arkansas And in the past few days hes been the unofficial presidential candidate coming out hardest against Chris Christies plan to cut Social SecurityHes not framing it in liberal terms  about how meanstesting Social Security would welfarize the program and erode its support  and he looked sort of confused when I tried to explain that argument But Huckabee has a problem as a vast majority of those affected almost certainly will with people paying into Social Security for decades and then not getting back whats owed them whether those cuts come in the form of meanstesting a raise in the retirement age or linking costofliving increases to chained CPI And since hes a professional politician who understands his audience hes spinning it another way the government isstealingthe money of the people You lent the government your money and theyre not letting you have it back ItsBig Government TheftThatll doHuckabee is good with people So is Chris Christie in his own unorthodox style Its an attribute he must have great strength in since hes preparing a campaign centered on yelling at people about cutting Social Security and Medicare Christie came to the summit to continue selling his plan Sharp cuts to social insurance programs are an extension of the overall Christie message of tough love or a belief that in Americas heart of heart lurks a masochist Christie said he is starting his run Unofficially Per the lawyers  with a 12point proposal on cutting entitlement spending because he wants to run a campaign based on strength clarity and hard truths Leadership is the other word Christie loves to employ To Christie leadership means the willingness to put forth these hard truths like how Social Security needs a good whooping Its a testament to his skills that hes even trying something like this But in order for it to be successful hell need to convince people that what hes saying and the policies hes pushing are the only possible correct ones That hes telling the truth and anyone who disagrees with him is a liar and his plan is literally the only way to shore up Social Security Medicare and Medicaid for the long haul If anyone can do this its Christie But its far from a sure thing that anyone can do this Another plank of Christies big plan is to reform Social Security disability benefits There are too many workingage people out there falsely claiming disability and we need to get them back in the workforce GrrDuring his QA segment a woman took issue with this part of the plan She told him that she has a 24yearold son with Aspergers syndrome and he cant keep a job so he really needs disability benefits Christie assures her that her sons case is legitimate and he has no intention of harming him The woman having secured a pledge from Christie to protect her sons bennies then asked Christie what hes going to do about all the illegals immigrants coming to take our jobs Near the end of his answer Christie acknowledged in another one of his hard truths that the 11 or 12 million undocumented immigrants in the country cannot be relied upon to all selfdeport Poor Mitt Romney Was this the part where humanitys truthiest truthteller was going to go allin for amnesty Not quite He merely suggested that leaders of both parties are going to have to come together to find a solution for that The reason it hasnt happened already according to Christie is that theres been no leadership from the White House You might think that pushing with its political might a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill would count assomekind of leadership on this issue but apparently not Thats just another hard truth from Chris Christie Independent Journal Review is a conservative viral news politics and culture site that gets something like ten trillion visitors a day Isnt that neat The outlet was a sponsor of the summit and held party at a nearby restaurant in collaboration with Facebook It was open bar and complemented by a sensational spread of fancy cheeses and little steak nibbly things I am not a food writer and fresh raw oysters on the half shell Free swag all over the place Internet money is the best money I walked out of the bathroom and there was Marco Rubio sitting at a big table all to himself on a laptop as though cramming a college paper about British Romanticism He was fielding questions on Facebook Rubio 43 is considered the youthful hip candidate in the field the 90s rap fan who really gets millennial culture Hes all about these edgy disruptive new technologies that allow politicians to respond to questions people submit on a website Facebook has gotten older but Instagram has gotten younger Rubio said to an Instagram representative after the QA He quickly corrected himself I mean Twitter has gotten older but Instagram has gotten younger Exactly After Rubio it was time for millennialsrealpresidential standardbearer John Bolton to do his Facebook QA Scott Brown was also at this party for some reason Ted Cruz shows no intention of dropping anytime soon his joke about how he would shut down the IRS and put all of its employees on the southern border though now he includes a disclaimer to the media that hes being tongueincheek Eliminating the IRS is part of his tax reform plan which is to institute a flat tax where returns can be filed on a standardsized postcard Which agency collects and enforces the flat tax postcards in our postIRS utopia Details details blah blah blah Were no fun in the media Cruz would also repeal every word of Obamacare and repeal every word of Common Core He makes it easy to remember at least You can fit Ted Cruzs policy platform on a standardsize postcard Cruz the final speaker of the event on Saturday was only able to take a couple of questions The Crowne Plaza in an aggressive pursuit of billings booked the ballroom where the conference was taking place for a wedding reception at 500 Cruz finished speaking at 400 The tight booking made for some interesting scenes as conference hangerson mingled with the newlyweds in their formalwear Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker was speaking at a small dinner event for select guests at the other end of the hotel but he took a respite from the dinner to congratulate the bridge and groom outside the bathroom A few hours later I walked out of my hotel with a few other reporters and there was Ted Cruz getting out of his car He looked exhausted so naturally we harassed him with more questions I asked him about Chris Christies Social Security plan and its many many hard truths He wouldnt endorse the plan itself of course but he did lay out his broad outlines for Social Security reform He supports gradually increasing the retirement age and having Social Security benefits grow to match inflation rather than having growth exceed inflation This is the idea behind linking costofliving increases to the slowergrowing chained CPI measure of inflation Just as the questions wrapped up with Cruzs aides tugging on him to walk away from reporters and get inside the sanctuary of his hotel room  you get the sense that this is a common occurrence  Cruz turned back and said to me that he hasnt given up on winning me over More tugging from the aides It turns out that Sen Ted Cruz is familiar withSalons coverage of Ted Cruzwhich is largely negative Though he didnt say so explicitly Ted Cruz clearly understands that his fate in the New Hampshire GOP primary rests on his ability to woo Salon The sooner they all realize this the better We take this gatekeeper role seriously and look forward to further engagement with him and our 18 other candidatefriends from the weekend Good luck to all
