On Friday morning the third day in his fourday New England campaign swing Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson told a joke He was the punch lineThis is a crazy election Johnson said looking out at dozens of Mainers who had come out for a breakfast meetandgreet You know how crazy this election is Im going to be the next president of the United States Thats how crazyJohnson a twoterm governor of New Mexico has avoided the fringe label that often sticks to thirdparty candidates Since announcing former Massachusetts governor William Weld as his running mate Johnson has risen in the polls to the high single digits  and to the midteens in some swing states His rallies draw hundreds of voters bigger than anything he saw during his 2012 bid He talks about spoiling the party and voters cheerDespite that Johnson is struggling to grab the prize he has eyed all year to be invited to the televised presidential debates He needs to close in on 15 percent in an average of polls and he is doing what he can Two super PACs are trying to boost him in Its not clear that they can pull it offTrump and advisers remain split on how far to move toward the middleThe support Johnson has so far is easily explained in a year of not one but two historically unpopular majorparty candidates voters are looking for an alternative to Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump Johnson may hold particular appeal for Republicans trying to protect their majorities in Congress he gives voters an alternative to Trump at the top of the ticket yet allows them to return to the GOP lineup down the ballotRelentlessly positive bounding from event to event in black Nikes and Carhartt jeans Johnson approaches the debate problem by talking like he has solved it In 2012 he briefly ran as a Republican  the party he was part of in Santa Fe  and was yanked offstage after a first flailing debate performanceI had 60 seconds to make my pitch and in the 60 seconds I was being interrupted Johnson said in an interview here Now I can say the same thing  and Ive got three minutes Uninterrupted Three people onstage audience bigger than the Super Bowl I dont think theyd get away with cutting meThey might The Commission on Presidential Debates which has controlled the process since 1988 has held fast to its 15 percent threshold A Johnsonbacked lawsuit against that threshold was thrown out this month however and the voters filing into JohnsonWeld rallies last week were acutely aware that their man might be kept offstageIm not for either of the choices we have right now said Roy Hermann 65 who caucused for Bernie Sanders but showed up in Portland to hear Johnson Im not even sure if Ill vote for this guy but I have a great deal of respect for himThe day before at a JohnsonWeld rally in Concord NH 14yearold Aubrey Pelletier hoisted a sign that read 15 Her father Brad 39 worried that too many voters limit the news they read and couldnt see the point of choosing JohnsonPeople are afraid of wasting their votes he surmised On Facebook I see Gary Johnson stuff all the time When I talk to people they know who he is nowAs Johnson and Weld stumped across New England they were recognized by voters  something new in the past three weeks they said Fundraising according to the campaign has surged in the same periodNeither Republicans nor Democrats know which nominee that helps The polls that show Johnson at or above 10 percent have Clintons lead growing if he is removed as a choice  but she has got a lead either way At rallies in New Hampshire and Maine voters with Bernie Sanders Tshirts stood near people wearing the Hillary for Prison shirts sold by farright radio host Alex Jones Some cheer when Johnson calls for ending corporate taxes some cheer when he insists that black lives matter All cheer when he endorses ballot measures to legalize marijuanaAsked whether he would encourage his voters to pick Republicans or Democrats when they went down their ballot Johnson demurred The wonderful thing about being a Libertarian is that you dont have to tell anybody to do anything he saidNew Trump campaign chief faces scrutiny over voter registration antiSemitismTwo libertarian efforts are underway to boost Johnson past the debate commissions 15percent hurdle Purple PAC steered by former Cato Institute president Ed Crane began a 1 million ad buy last week with cable spots casting Johnson as an honorable choice who favors tolerance and free marketsTheyre not as ideological as I would probably prefer Crane said of Johnson and Weld But on the broad issues of social tolerance restraint in foreign policy markets over crony capitalism theyre very goodAlternative PAC launched by former FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe is spending 50000 to kickstart a Web campaign aimed at millennials One ad Balanced Rebellion stars an Abraham Lincoln impersonator who promises that Johnson wont send you to fight wars overseas or tell you who to marryIts like a twohorse race where one horse cheats and the other one eats Muslims the Lincoln actor says of the ClintonTrump raceThe spot was designed by Harmon Brothers the firm behind a viral ad in which unicorns defecate rainbow ice cream to promote a toilet aidJohnson is more tactful In his campaign speech an optimistic spiel on how free markets Uber everything and active citizens can fix the country he tells one joke about Trump The Republican nominee he said watched the Olympics to see how high those Mexican pole vaulters could go Neither Johnson nor Weld is inclined to attack Clinton something they have been trying to correctYou make mistakes along the trail Johnson said in Concord referring to a CNN town hall  one of his highestprofile events  where he declined to criticize Clinton If I had to do that over again Id have said Shes beholdenIve made a minicareer of defending Mrs Clinton on the use of the private server said Weld who added that newer revelations about her email gave him pauseThat light tone has become central to the JohnsonWeld campaign The two standardbearers for libertarianism have become some of the least ideological candidates in AmericaOn the stump Weld describes the Libertarian Party as a sixlane highway going right up the middle between the two parties and Johnson talks about what can be achieved when partisans cross the aisleThat has led to steady criticism from more traditional libertarians who pounce on every Johnson or Weld sop to the center as a gaffe Weld who signed a guncontrol bill as governor struggled to win the Libertarian vicepresidential nomination Jason Sorens the founder of the Free State Project that encourages libertarians to move to New Hampshire said he had seen some demobilization of the LP tickets natural base over gunsAfter Johnson refused to rule out a tax on carbon  only if it were revenueneutral and it replaced income taxes  he was criticized by libertarians on social mediaCrane Kibbe and other libertarians knew some of this was coming The Republican primary campaign of Sen Rand Paul Ky designed to build on the support of father Ron Pauls three libertarianflavored presidential bids

who ran against Johnson for the Libertarian presidential nomination I know a few people who have said Well hes the lesser of the evils The lesser evil is still evil in my eyesBut the dazzling possibility of the debate invite  something no Libertarian candidate has ever achieved  has kept most fellow travelers on board Dan Fishman the campaigns 48yearold New England director has walked away from each rally with pages of new signups Its getting easier and easier to train people he said crediting the NationBuilder software that had helped the Trump campaign convert its giant crowds into
