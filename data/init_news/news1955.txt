Email To view photojournalist Orin Langelles new online photography exhibit If Voting Changed Things is to accept a challenge Dont expect a passive viewing of simple aesthetically pleasing photography or a mindless stroll through apolitical eye candy The challenge should be apparent from the title of the exhibit It is a riddle a fragment an incomplete sentence awaiting your contribution To view his display is to realize that there is no single way to finish the statement Langelle invites you to see the complexity of the world through his lens but to draw your own conclusions about the meaning of the images If Voting Changed Things people would vote They dont Only 58 of eligible voters did in the last presidential election Recent polls indicate that the majority of Americans feel disenfranchised by the 2016 presidential election process and candidates They arent proud or hopeful about the outcome and half of Americans feel helpless There is no emphasis on issues that matter to them Election discussion centers around voting for the least worst candidate which makes civic duty seem like an exercise in selfdenial and a concession that our aspirations are not achievable Of course the counter is that if you dont vote youre giving someone else the power to make decisions for you But that perspective ignores the range of opportunities for civic engagement and citizen action Protesting demonstrating picketing civil disobedience rallies striking tax resistance boycotting sitins sabotage hacking and DDoS treesitting resistance lawbreaking insurrection rebellion revolution Langelles images of protest activity outside of national conventions in 1972 and 2004 raise the question of whether voting and the electoral circus that accompanies it is about citizen empowerment or an explicit and ceremonial abdication of power by citizens to a status quo elite Which leads to the observation that If Voting Changed Things they wouldnt let us do it Chomsky wrote that The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion but allow very lively debate within that spectrumeven encourage the more critical and dissident views That gives people the sense that theres free thinking going on while all the time the presuppositions of the system are being reinforced by the limits put on the range of debate Photographs from 1972 and 2004 capture moments outside of the system beyond the framing of the acceptable discourse Protesters explicitly reject governmental authority through symbols slogans caricatures and artwork The elephant pulling a coffin through Miamis city streets conveys a belief that political parties are leading us to death and destruction The black hoods and orange jump suits communicate that protesters in Boston relegated to a Free Speech Zone have become the equivalent of Guantanamo Bay detained terrorist suspects It is not accidental that the media ignores or minimalizes these displays of collective action In 2016 delegatesthe people who were there never mind viewers at homeat the Republican and Democratic National Conventions remarked that they were unaware that protests were occurring outside throughout Langelle deftly illustrates that this is because authorities have increasingly managed and marginalized protest behavior Which demonstrates that If Voting Changed Things  this exhibit wouldnt be necessary For many Langelles work will be shocking because it lays bare the evolution of policing and the criminalization of dissent Photos of the 1972 demonstrations include arson sabotage gratuitous nudity and graffiti that challenges AmerikaLove it or Destroy it and yet not a single police officer is identifiable among the activists The activists are in the streets climbing in trees occupying fields and grassy lawns neighborhoods and parks Contrast this with images of Boston Police in 2004 appearing ready for war in riot gear armed with Tasers guns clubs a menacing and ubiquitous presence atop scaffolding towers Because of new draconian laws protesters have been herded into holding pens of chain link fences and razor wire surrounded by surveillance cameras concrete and girders The photos depict a world that has changed drastically in thirty years and which has militarized against marginalized and narrowly framed the acceptable boundaries of citizen dissent Moreover If Voting Changed Things  it wouldnt contrast so distinctly with other forms of citizen action There is a humor and a vibrancy to the people that Langelle juxtaposes brilliantly against the sterile and colorless state apparatus There is a diversity of skin color age gender among the protesters Their slogans are racy their clothing is colorful and fun They wield musical instruments engage in guerilla theatre and share poetry They engage in property destruction with ironywearing clogs as they break windows and asking through their graffitti with gallows humor if the protest restraint area represents the Land of the Free Their defiance comes in the form of patches to be worn on the derriere sold by a young girl in a flowered dress They paint their faces and wear straw hats The stark reality of the state is helmeted with dark gray protective gear and weapons to enforce compliance The only colors are the red white and blue banners and flags that appear more as a hypocritical challenge to the popular movements than a patriotic display It is evident that Langelle sees a dour system that is oppressive and lifeless Voting is a part of that system a reinforcement of its values and an affirmation of the status quo If Voting Changed Things marginalized groups wouldnt be in the streets The electoral process in America has produced and validated a government that has produced institutional racism militarization within and from our society mass incarceration crippling debt perpetual war homelessness a failed health care system eroding and ineffective education and environmental exploitation If Voting Changed Things we wouldnt have a 1 We wouldnt allow the 01 16000 Americans  to hold as much wealth 9 trillion as 80 percent of the nations population  some 256000000 people  and as much as 75 percent of the entire worlds population We wouldnt allow the five largest white landowners in America to own more agricultural land than all of black America If Voting Changed Things demographics wouldnt be used as a basis for electoral strategies We would vote away the cleavages that exist across generations racial and cultural groups religious affiliations But we dont because we cant If Voting Changed Things would we be where we are The work of Orin Langelle may offer you a lens from which to answer that question Or to find your own conclusion to the sentence If Voting Changed Things can be viewed online at If Voting Changed Things Exhibit Online  It is also on display at the Buen Vivir Gallery for Contemporary Art in
