The Obama administration just wrapped up another big year for regulations and executive actions  pushing through everything from a new type of retirement account to a deportation reprieve affecting millions of illegal immigrants to longawaited standards for coal wasteBut thousands of proposed regulations remain on the table and could set the stage for a rush of rulemaking in the presidents final two years in officeSome of the biggest items are expected from the Environmental Protection Agency which is set to finalize several landmark rules in 2015 Perhaps the most controversial concern new regulations on coalfired power plantsThe Obama administration is trying to get fossilfuel fired power plants to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent from 2005 levels by 2030The EPA proposed the rules last year and is set to finalize them by summer 2015But with Republicans taking control of the Senate and boosting their numbers in the House incoming leaders are girding for battleIncoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a Republican who represents the coal state of Kentucky told The Associated Press last month hell do all he can to stop regulations hurting the industryThough the administration is pushing the regulations as part of a broad plan to improve air quality and curb global warming McConnell told the AP My first obligation is to protect my people who are hurting as the result of what this administration is doingHe added Im going to do any and everything I can to stop itAccording to the Competitive Enterprise Institute the Obama administration put out 2375 proposed rules in 2014 that are still under consideration Thats in addition to 3541 final rules and regulations in 2014 according to CEIThe sheer number of rules from the Obama administration is not unprecedented Early in the George W Bush administration the annual number of rules topped 4000 But critics say this administration is imposing more expensive regulationsAmong them is a controversial EPA proposal to expand regulatory power over streams and wetlands The agency set to finalize the rule in April estimates it could impose costs of between 162 million to 278 million per year but says public benefits outweigh the costs  since the EPA says the changes would reduce flooding support hunting and fishing and ease pollutionRepublicans though have described the maneuver as a massive land grabThe plan would define which specific waterways the EPA can regulate The Clean Water Act already gives the EPA the ability to regulate US waters but Supreme Court rulings have left the specifics unclear when it comes to waters that flow only part of the yearThe EPA claims this does not expand its authority and only clarifies itBut detractors claim it is an opening for the EPA to claim authority over countless waterways including streams that only show up during heavy rainfall Critics warn this could create more red tape for property owners and businesses if they happen to have even small streams on their landRep Lamar Smith RTexas chairman of the House Science Space and Technology Committee has called it an effort to control a huge amount of private property across the countryIn another EPA initiative the agency is looking to October to finalize sweeping ozone regulationsIn proposing the limits on smogforming pollution linked to asthma and respiratory illness in November EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy argued that the public health benefits far outweigh the costs and that most of the US can meet the tougher standards without doing anything newWe need to be smart  as we always have  in trying to find the best benefits in a way that will continue to grow the economy McCarthy said Of reducing ozone she added Weve done it before and were on track to do it againBut business groups panned the proposal as unnecessary and the costliest in history warning it could jeopardize a resurgence in American manufacturingPresident Obama initially had pulled the EPAs proposed ozone limits amid intense pressure from industry and the GOP But public health groups sued and a federal court ordered the EPA to issue a new draft smog rule by last month  which the agency didThe rules are estimated to cost industry anywhere between 39 billion and 15 billion by 2025 That price tag would exceed that of any previous environmental regulation in the US Environmental groups are pushing for stricter limits stillOn other fronts the Federal Communications Commission could move in a matter of months to propose new net neutrality rules Obama weighed in on that debate late last year urging the FCC to regulate the Internet like other utilitiesThe White House is calling for an explicit ban on deals between broadband Internet providers and online services like Netflix Amazon or YouTube to move their content faster a potential new source of revenue for cable companies While the FCC is an independent agency Obamas statement could put political pressure on FCC commissionersMeanwhile the National Labor Relations Board has issued new rules for socalled ambush union elections  speeding up elections and requiring employers to give unions contact information for workers The rules take effect in AprilThe Associated Press contributed to this report
