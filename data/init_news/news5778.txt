Donald Trump believes he won the first presidential debate Hes proclaimed that publicly and told me so himselfSome of his advisers disagree and they believe his debate prep was something of a disasterOne wellplaced source told me that there were too many people in the room during these sessions as many as a dozen at a time and some including two generals had no experience with debates or even campaigns The result was that the candidate got lots of conflicting advice on what to say and do from a team that hadnt even agreed internally on the best strategiesIm also told that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell hardly unabashed Trump fans provided debate advice by phoneThe result in this sources view is that Trump was overprepared which left him without a clear plan to deliver his message or respond to Hillary Clintons jibesA harsher indictment was delivered to the New York Times one in which Trump advisers attempted to blame the bossIts striking that they would criticize their candidate from behind a curtain of anonymity In effect theyre saying hey dont blame us we tried to tell him but he wouldnt listenOr viewed another way they are using the press to send him a message that he needs to change his approach for the second debate in St LouisNow much of this is inside baseball Hillary Clinton is widely credited even by many conservative commentators as having delivered a strong performance at Hofstra and kept her opponent on the defensive She will probably get a polling bump of a couple of points But Trumps supporters remain in in his corner after watching him go toetotoe with a former secretary of State without committing a major gaffeWhen campaigns are in a tailspin loyalty sometimes melts as its consultants and strategists scramble to salvage their own reputations at the boss expense But Trump against all the odds set by the pundits is in an extremely competitive race against Clinton and could win the thingCampaign advisers to Donald J Trump concerned that his focus and objectives had dissolved during the first presidential debate on Monday plan to more rigorously prepare him for his next faceoffbut that whether he is open to practicing meticulously is a major concernYes that is the sound of some folks throwing the nominee under the busThese unnamed sources were privately awash in secondguessing about why he stopped attacking Mrs Clinton on trade and character issues and instead grew erratic impatient and subdued as the night went on In interviews seven campaign aides and advisers most of whom sought anonymity to speak candidly expressed frustration and discouragement over their candidates performance  The Gang of Seven is clearly ticked offThe last time this kind of internal carping hit the press during the let Trump be Trump debate Paul Manafort was gone and Steve Bannon and Kellyanne Conway were tapped to run the showTrumps fans are angry at the media coverage portraying him as having lost the debate at least according to my Twitter feed And who knows Its not like the press hasnt been repeatedly wrong about TrumpBut a story in which some of Trumps own advisers are anonymously quoted as saying he was erratic in a debate watched by 84 million people doesnt help the cause Even if the Times reporters sought out these sources you dont usually see Hillary advisers anonymously griping about their candidateEven successful campaigns go through neardeath experiences Clinton was sliding in the polls through her pneumonia period and Democrats were starting to panic In the end the burden is on Trump himself and not his inner circle to find a way to winHoward Dean standing by his ludicrous suggestion that Donald Trump might have a coke problem makes me want to  scream Its outrageous for a doctor exgovernor and former presidential candidate and party chairman to act like a smear merchant Kudos to MSNBCs Joe Scarborough for calling on his colleague to apologizeA former Chris Christie ally David Wildstein has testified that the governor laughed when he told him the George Washington Bridge lanes were being closed as an act of political retaliation I dont know if thats true and the former presidential candidate has denied it but imagine if Trump had chosen Christie as his running mateHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
