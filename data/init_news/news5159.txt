BROOKLYN Iowa  Ted Cruz has made a name for himself losing big political fights Now facing down his biggest battle yet as a candidate for president Cruz is grappling with the new challenge of assuring voters that he can not only fight but winThat pressure on Cruz shone through Friday as he presented himself for the small crowd at a town hall here as the only conservative in the Republican field who is also a viable candidateThere are sixteen Republican candidates Of the sixteen do you know which campaign raised the most hard money We did Cruz boasted to loud cheers Three months ago if someone had suggested to you that Cruz was going to outraise Jeb Bush youd have told them Look I think you need to lay off the bottle a little bit That aint gonna happenIndeed the latest round of campaign finance reports confirmed that Cruz raked in 143 million not including an independent haul on the super PAC side Although Jeb Bush brought in much more on the super PAC side making him the undisputed GOP money leader his campaign brought in 112 million  three million less than CruzBut the idea of the noted firebrand Cruz pushing political pragmatism can be jarring He cemented his national reputation as a scorchedearth conservative in 2013 playing a leading role in shutting down the federal government over a quixotic bid to block funding for ObamacareIn his campaign for president Cruz isnt glossing over that and other bruising battles he has waged even as he is being implicitly called out by other candidates for having consistently come up shortThere are really two kinds of candidates Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker told reporters in Davenport Iowa on Friday There are fighters in Washington who prefer fighting but have yet to win those fights largely and then there are winners people who have won elections but havent consistently been involved in the fights of the last few years that really matterWhat makes us unique iswe can do both Walker continued We can fight and winWhen presented later Friday with these remarks Cruz insisted Republican primary voters are going to ask of every candidate in the field Show me where youve stood and led on the great battles of the day And he ticked off issues Common Core Obamacare the Religious Freedom Act in Indiana the presidents executive orders on immigration the Iran deal and moreThere are many good people in this race who I like and respect But there is a stark difference in the records of the candidates Cruz said There are campaign conservatives who talk conservative when theyre on the campaign trail and yet their record isnt conservative I am the candidate in this race who is the consistent conservative over and over againEven Cruzs steadfast vocal conservatism is not without political calculation of course In a broad field of Republican candidates he and his campaign team see a lane for a nocompromise conservative in particular one who can harness grassroots support while cultivating larger donorsCruzs model builds on what he sees as the mistakes of conservative candidates in 2012 to take advantage of deep misgivings about Mitt Romney during the Republican primary which manifested in multiple candidates  Michele Bachmann Herman Cain Newt Gingrich Rick Santorum  having their moments in the spotlight and at the top of the pollsBut none of them were in positions to be able to raise substantial sums of money Cruz said in an interview prior to his town hall Friday So every time one of them popped up to the polls theyd get hit with 10 million in attack ads and theyd be road killTo supporters and the press Cruz is making the case that establishment Republicans hope to win in the primary by splintering the conservative vote  and that he with his robust campaign infrastructure is the antidote to thatThe Washington establishments plan is simple They want to divide conservatives Cruz added in the interview That is the only way the moderate establishment candidate sneaks up the middle with 23 percent of the vote and runs away with the nomination If conservatives unite its game over
