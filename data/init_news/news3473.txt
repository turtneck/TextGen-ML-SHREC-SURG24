Hes best known for bankrolling Republicans Rick Santorum and Scott Walker afloat but Foster Friess has a new cause a long way from DCThere is no reason why this monopoly for equipping should be owned by the US government I think theres a role for private organizations to generate private support to help the Kurds said Audino who as a soldier was stationed in Kurdistan for a year Foster and I are certainly talking about it in concept No ones pulled the trigger on itWhen I visited Camp Black Tiger I was amazed to see how many of the fighters had come out of retirement and were in their 40s and 50s Friess said I had tears in my eyes to see the Yazidis an ethnic minority as I passed out 5000 blankets to them which our family had purchased from Turkey To think they had to leave their homes and everything they owned and only had the clothes on their backs was indeed sadFriess is shooting for practical targets Whats the most practical target right now The easiest target right now is lets help the United States directly equip the Kurds said Brig Gen Audino who serves as an informal adviser to Friess on Kurdish issues He has a genuinely good heart and he wants to stay on the right side of history He sees the awful slaughter of innocents in Iraq and Syria right now He doesnt see that ending at Iraqi and Syrian bordersSmall wonder that rumors have been spreading among antiISIS Westerners that Friess could soon be bankrolling their efforts Matthew VanDyke runs a security contracting firm called Sons of Liberty International in Iraq which provides free military training to local Christians in Kurdish and Iraqi areas He said he had heard that Friess pledged to help fund the Peshmerga and had been looking to get in touch with him ever sinceThe Kurds have been seen as protectors of the Christians especially since the fall of Saddam in 2003 when the Christians began to be pushed out of and even murdered in Arab Iraq By contrast the Christians have been thriving in the Kurdish region of Iraq said Professor Michael Gunter who has written 11 books on the Kurdish peopleIf a highprofile Christian American businessman were to privately fund weapons in the ISIS battlespace it would be a problematic foray into an alreadynasty sectarian situation So far Friess has stayed away from that role While the Kurds welcome any help they can get from Christian Americans ISIS has framed its war as one of them versus the crusadersAnd there may be some coming legislative efforts Sen John Barrasso Gabbard and others huddled with Friess in Grahams conference room last month to work on a bill called the Kurdish Emergency Relief Act the Washington Examiner reported which would involve some 500 million in aid for the Kurdish people The legislation has not yet been introduced
