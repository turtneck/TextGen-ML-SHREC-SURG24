Watch the CNN Republican debate Tuesday December 15 at 600 pm ET and 830 pm ETThe GOP establishment confronted by a recalcitrant electorate that refuses to leave Donald Trump is being forced to take a fresh look at Ted Cruz  a man with grassroots strength in key early primary states and few friends in WashingtonSuddenly the Republican Partys best hope could be a man hellbent on transforming it a senator who openly spars with fellow GOP colleagues and has campaigned by painting its leaders as spineless and feebleHeaded into Tuesdays CNN Republican presidential debate Cruz and Trump have turned Iowa into a twoman race with the Texan leading in two new polls Cruz is up 31 to Trumps 21 among likely GOP caucusgoers according to the Bloomberg PoliticsDes Moines Register poll released Saturday A Fox News poll Sunday has Cruz leading Trump 28 to 26A small and growing number of Republicans allied with the establishment  the force long thought to quickly consolidate against a surging Cruz bid  are coming to terms with the idea that he may be palatable in an election cycle where Trump has pushed the envelope well beyond what they considered acceptableOh God yes said Ed Rogers a top Republican lobbyist when asked if hed prefer Cruz Compared to Trump hes OKEstablishment Republicans had enough of a problem when Trump began his populistfueled move to the top of national polls where he has stubbornly remained for five months But Cruzs steady rise means that even if Trump were taken out by a wellfinanced negative campaign they might have to deal with a stronger Cruz who has more political polish than the more improvisational TrumpIf you talk to my peers around town collectively its an appreciation the guy is smart as hell explained a senior Washington Republican who is backing another candidate He can be a more acceptable alternative to Trump if it comes to thatThe irony hasnt escaped them Said the Republican Its an interesting life  and everythings relativeThe second he starts to look like a winner in Washington Rogers said hes going to have a bunch of new friendsIts a dilemma swatted away on Capitol Hill  perhaps optimisticallyAsked about choosing Trump or Cruz 2008 nominee Sen John McCain would only allow that they are smart people Bush backer Sen Susan Collins would just offer that they are obviously not my choiceAnd theres no guarantee either one can beat Hillary ClintonHes not as outrageous as Trump but I dont know that hes any more electable than Trump said Charlie Black a senior adviser to Republican presidential campaigns for over two decadesBrian Walsh a longtime Senate campaign aide said its an outofcontrol Trump  not an incontrol Cruz  that explains the Texans growing appealTrump has gone so far that it has in some ways masked how problematic Cruz would be as the nominee as well he saidDespite his background as an Ivy Leagueeducated attorney and his time in the Bush administration Cruz rose to prominence as a tea party darling who became the national face of the 2013 government shutdown Cruz has spent the two years since working to salvage his relationship with some potential investors in his campaign but he has reveled in his image as a Washington bad boy the only senator willing to do on Capitol Hill what he campaigned on back at homeIts something that has made him enemies in Washington where he has not convinced a single Senate colleague to back his campaign Cruz helped push Republicans to shut down the government in a highstakes fight over Obamacare a strategy that failed to get results but didnt cause a predicted electoral meltdownOn the trail he has shown no willingness to moderate his positions bragging about his conservative purity and his rabblerousing reputation in the CapitolBut even compared to Cruzs burnitdown rhetoric Trumps campaign has been more incendiary and worrisome for party elders determined to beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton The mogul had harsh things to say about Hispanics prisoners of war women in the media the disabled and most recently Muslims who he thinks temporarily should not be allowed to enter the United StatesAnd most concerning for GOP leaders Trump has frequently floated leaving the Republican Party altogether to mount an independent bid which would significantly increase Clintons chances of winning the White HouseThe pair appears to be heading toward a clash that Cruz at least long sought to delay On Friday evening about 24 hours after audio leaked of Cruz questioning Trumps judgment at a private fundraiser the real estate mogul launched his first attacks on CruzCruz had attempted to head that off by alleging that mainstream Republicans were trying to sow discordThe Establishments only hope Trump  me in a cage match he tweeted Friday morning Sorry to disappoint  realdonaldtrump is terrific DealWithItCruz has done little to woo the Republicans he used as his bogeyman He has raised the lions share of his money far from the New YorktoWashington corridor raced to the partys right flank on every issue of the day and campaigned loudly on the polarizing social issues that one wellplaced Republican said puts some contributors permanently out of reachCruz on paper should not be as repellent to the GOP political class as he is Nurtured by the George W Bush network in Texas he served as solicitor general before winning an upset bid in the 2012 Republican US Senate primaryTo Stuart Stevens the chief strategist for Mitt Romneys 2012 campaign that resume should theoretically make him attractive to the partys eliteAt a core of Cruzs candidacy is a great phonyism Stevens said of the selfstylized insurgent You can wear all the plaid shirts and shoot off all the automatic weapons you want but youre an insiderAnd some of his positions such as on national security do hew closely to the partys center As Cruz held court on MSNBCs Morning Joe last week you couldve sworn he was working for George Herbert Walker Bush on his foreign policy a senior Republican saidBut a leading Republican in frequent touch with highlevel donors said even though those contributors may despise Cruz they are learning to live with him If thats what we need to do to beat Trump the Republican said then thats what you get
