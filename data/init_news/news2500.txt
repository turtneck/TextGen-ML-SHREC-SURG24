Some of the rhetoric on the left about the awful shootings at the Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado is troubling  Some of the rhetoric on the right after such cases has also been troubling  I say this to pundits and politicians after each tragedy Dont demonize the other side because some crazy guy goes on a shooting spree But its a temptation that many are unable to resist  Words matter of course and rhetoric can be incendiary But its still unfair to draw a link between media and political debate and some violent sociopath who doesnt value human life  Inevitably were left with a wave of fingerpointing over which party is politicizing the situation which unfortunately diverts attention from the victims  It didnt take long after Fridays shooting in Colorado Springs which killed three people including a police officer and wounded nine others Democrats rushed to put out statements and Republican presidential candidates were mostly silent  Hillary Clinton after a supportive we StandWithPP tweet said We should be supporting Planned Parenthood not attacking itAnd it is way past time to protect womens health and respect womens rights not use them as political footballs  President Obama as he has after other mass shootings turned to gun control saying that if we truly care about this we have to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our streets to people who have no business wielding them Period Enough is enough  Both statements could be called political but were relatively restrained in tone  I get that the GOP candidates are staunchly opposed to abortion and have been sharply critical of Planned Parenthood especially after the deeply disturbing videos in which staffers spoke cavalierly about the harvesting of fetal organs which prompted an apology from the groups president and a change in its practice  But three peopleincluding an Iraq war veteran a mother of twoare dead because they were at a clinic that provides a legal service  Ted Cruz Jeb Bush and John Kasich put out statements of sympathy for the victims in the 36 hours after the attack Would the others have acted differently if the police officer had been murdered at a Starbucks instead  Still Planned Parenthoods executive vice president Dawn Laguens ratcheted things up significantly by declaring it is offensive and outrageous that some politicians are now claiming this tragedy has nothing to do with the toxic environment they helped create Even when the gunman was still inside of our health center politicians who have long opposed safe and legal abortion were on television pushing their campaign to defund Planned Parenthood  Vicki Saporta president of the National Abortion Federation said those opposed to abortion have ignited a firestorm of hate and knew there could be these types of consequences So the murders are not a huge surprise she told the Washington Post  Sorry but linking the actions of a mentally disturbed gunman to the toxic environment that Republicans helped create is the old bloodonthehands argument So is firestorm of hate language Opponents of abortion and critics of Planned Parenthood are in no way responsible for this terrible crime  On Fox News Sunday Carly Fiorina reiterated her opposition to Planned Parenthood and said while the attack was obviously a tragedy anyone who tries to link this terrible tragedy to anyone that oppose abortion or opposes the sale of body parts is engaging in typical leftwing tactics  Mike Huckabee on CNN called the attack domestic terrorism that is absolutely abominable especially to those of us in the prolife movement because theres nothing about any of us that would condone or any way look the other way at something like this He then likened the murders to what goes on inside Planned Parenthood clinics where many millions of babies die  Cruz denounced some vicious rhetoric on the left blaming those who are prolifeThe media promptly wants to blame him on the prolife movement when at this point theres very little evidence to indicate that  But sometimes the guiltbyassociation allegations fly the other way  When two Ferguson police officers were shot in March Front Page magazine ran this headline Obama and the Media Have the Blood of Cops on Their Hands  When a sheriffs deputy was killed in Houston in August Cruz said Cops across this country are feeling the assault Theyre feeling the assault from the president from the top on down as we see  whether its in Ferguson or Baltimore the response from senior officials the president or the attorney general is to vilify law enforcement  I understand that passions run high in these life and death cases But partisan blameshifting doesnt help the situation and simply becomes one more political brawl
