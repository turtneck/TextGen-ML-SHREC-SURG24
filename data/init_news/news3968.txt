The GOPled Senate is expected to vote next week on legislation that keeps the Department of Homeland Security fully operational through February but parts of the bill that attempt to reverse President Obamas immigration policy set up a major showdown with DemocratsThe expected political battle started before Republicans took control of the upper chamber when the parties agreed on a temporary spending bill that essentially funded the entire federal government through the fiscal year with the exception of the homeland security departmentIt was a defiant move by the GOPled House in response to Obamas recent executive actions on illegal immigration which Democrats accepted as part of the larger budget deal and that also included significant compromises on both sidesThe House has already passed the bill which will keep the department fully operational past Feb 27But passage in the Senate will be more difficult with Democrats vowing strong opposition and Republicans unlikely to not get the 60 votes needed to overcome the Democrats filibusterObama and fellow party members also have urged Republicans to pass a funding bill for the agency clean of any language attempting to roll back the executive actions And the president has also threatened to veto such legislationSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated the first vote on the House bill will be Tuesday But whether the Kentucky Republican allows amendments like he did with the Keystone XL Pipeline legislation remains unclearIts a debate that will challenge our colleagues on the other side with a simple proposition Do they think presidents of either party should have the power to simply ignore laws that they dont like McConnell RKy said on the Senate floorWill our Democratic colleagues work with us to defend key democratic ideals like separation of powers and the rule of law  The House bill does two things  funds the Department of Homeland Security and reigns in executive overreach Thats it Its that simpleThe Housepassed bill provides 397 billion to finance the department through the rest of the budget year for counterterrorism cybersecurity and other priorities at a time when attacks in Paris and elsewhere are fresh in the publics mind Unaffected by the measure is additional money the agency receives from feesAs passed in the House the legislation would also reverse Obamas decision last fall to provide temporary deportation relief and work permits to an estimated 4 million immigrants in the country illegally mostly people who have children who are citizens or legal permanent residentsThe bill also would eliminate a 2012 directive that has granted work permits and stays of deportation to more than 600000 immigrants who arrived illegally in the US under the age of 16The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the measure would increase the federal deficit by 75 billion over a decadeThe Associated Press contributed to this report
