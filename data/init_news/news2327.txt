He has been roundly condemned for these statement by key GOP figureheads like Senator Lindsey Graham who called him a xenophobic racebaiting religious bigot But the GOP should understand Trumps popularity as a case of their chickens coming home to roost The modern Republican Party has secured its base by pandering to the worst impulses of white male working class and white Christian fundamentalist rage Only Trump doesnt use a dogwhistle He barks And every time he does the GOP base responds by replenishing his poll numbersAlthough this doesnt seem like a viable longterm strategy the shortterm effects are important to watch The responsiveness of the American public to his rhetoric of keeping white people safe reminds us again of the extent to which narratives about white safety drive US social policy particularly on the right For the cause of white safety much of the American public finds it reasonable to restrict the movement of Muslims both inside and outside of the US But we dont restrict conservative white men on the grounds that they disproportionately commit mass shootings at public places  churches schools and colleges movie theaters and health care facilitiesAnother major effect of Trumps rhetoric is the increased threat of violence that Muslim Americans face because a frontrunning candidate for the presidency is using reckless discourse to substantiate the legitimacy of Islamophobic views Since the Paris attacks last month there has been a sharp uptick in vandalism and violent rhetoric against mosques in the US and abroad My Muslim colleagues and friends have described feelings of heightened anxiety and fear as they move through public space and send their children to school In New York a young schoolgirl was attacked by classmates who called her ISIS and tried to rip off her hijabThe GOP base is not merely racially ignorant they are also prone to violence By Trumps logic we should be placing tracking devices on all socially conservative white men who own guns We should be interrogating the source of these white mens radical views We should understand the Church particularly the conservative evangelical church as a breeding ground for white terrorism White evangelicalism is the fundamentalist ideological arm of white social conservatism and of white American male terrorismThe story of 21stcentury US state violence is not only a story of antiBlackness It is also a story of statesanctioned Islamophobia that uses the tragic terroristic acts of 911 as a framework to mistreat Muslim Americans and other Americans who appear to be of Arab or Middle Eastern descent There is no acknowledgement that not all Arabs are MuslimsUsing the extreme acts of a few to condemn the peaceful lives of the many is a hallmark of the American script of racism White Americans do this to Black people when they suggest that Black intraracial violence justifies the overpolicing of all Black people Americans do this to Muslims when we demand that key Islamic religious leaders step forward to quickly condemn the violence so that we will not mistake lack of censure for allegianceYet we did not require or expect conservative white male politicians and religious leaders to issue statements after the Planned Parenthood shooting affirming that Christian social values are antiviolent and condemning the actions of the shooter as an egregious mischaracterization of Christian values and principles We did not ask all white men to feel shame over the actions of the shooter The myth of white individualism absolves white people of a collective reckoning with the ways that white fundamentalism breeds violence against people of all colors and social backgrounds This is why we must begin to understand whiteness as a kind of violent fundamentalism one at the heart of the American project Fundamentalism is always a struggle over values and an attempt by those who feel marginalized to order the universe through a set of moral absolutes that notsocoincidentally also concede power to their particular worldview Donald Trump is not particularly religious despite his meeting with Black pastors But he deploys whiteness as ideology with the fundamentalist zeal of the worst kinds of religious zealots and proselytizers His rhetoric about protecting the USMexico borderrhetoric that has been unfortunately taken up by two misguided Black female Trump enthusiastsis just one more example of the kind of power laden demands for purity that adhere to fundamentalist ideologies Whiteness as a fundamentalist ideology frames all others as enemies of the project of white supremacy It authorizes violence against all who divest from the project of whiteness It uses a narrative of marginalization and the need to regain power to take America back to justify aggressive and violent acts towards nonwhite groups And it values and seeks to perpetuate whiteness as a way of life Until we dismantle white fundamentalism no people of color will be safe All fundamentalist belief systems view other belief systems in zerosum terms Evangelical Christianity believes that the truer it is the less true every other belief system is WhiteAmerican fundamentalism and Islamic fundamentalism also engage each other in zerosum geopolitical terms They will be locked into an endlessly violent battle of wills To make it more plain on the homefront white Americans respond so strongly to acts of Islamic terror and with such fear because they recognize this same capacity for fundamentalist rage in themselves In a zerosum battle of fundamentalism either we are invading their shores or they are invading ours Game recognize game But terror and violence are not a game People of color frequently become casualities of war in these internecine battles of competing fundamentalisms Reinscribing whiteness and pedaling white fundamentalism as an ideology befitting of the 21st century will cause innumerable harm to all people of color As a case in point Trump used the Japanese internment to justify his current ideas about Muslims And this is perhaps one of the most fundamental lessons that this Black Lives Matter moment can teach us a nation that is wholly adversarial to Black life is not a nation fit for any nonwhite lives to inhabit In America Islamic fundamentalism is not our biggest threat White fundamentalism is And it is long past time for us to do something about it
