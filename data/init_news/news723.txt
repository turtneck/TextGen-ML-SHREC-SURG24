Mall of America to Close for First Time Ever on Thanksgiving Nov 11 2016 0 0 For the first time ever the Mall of America will close on Thanksgiving Day This represents a sea change Instead of fighting crowds on Black Friday to buy the latest gadgets hundreds of thousands of Americans will instead be home spending time with their families and friends and 15000 employees will enjoy the same opportunity which many consumerfocused shoppers have often taken for granted Mall of America officials just announced that they were veering from their tradition of staying open from the morning of Thanksgiving day into Black Friday The super mall home to 520 stores in Bloomington Minnesota will stay closed on November 24th except for certain operations like the Walk to End Hunger fundraiser The mall will reopen the following morning at 5am with a ribbon cutting ceremony for anxious customers Americans are Drowning in Their Stuff The Average American Household Contains 300000 Items You dont have to be an extreme minimalist to appreciate the fact that Americans more than in almost any other country have too much stuff The LA Times reports that there are more than 300000 items in the average American home Even the size of the average home has tripled over the last ten years Youve got to have the space to put all that stuff And yet one in five Americans rents an offsite storage space to put their overflow This is the fastest growing sector of commercial real estate in the past four years according to the NY Times even though America is home to 50000 storage facilities  more than five times the number of Starbucks It could do us good if malls closed their doors more often Americans spend trillions on goods and services that they dont really need This includes booze jewelry and sports paraphernalia We spend more on shoes jewelry and watches than we do on education While this fact alone doesnt necessarily point to a habit of overt consumerism in many cases it does point to an ethos of unsustainability Much of Our Stuff is Toxic As the Story of Stuff details many of the products we purchase contribute to the degradation of our environment  from the petrochemicals used in our cars and in our hand lotions to a seemingly benign glass of water which comes from a plastic bottle From nonstick cookware to handsanitizer showercurtains to furniture  we are living with a multitude of consumer purchases that are not good for us Our childrens toys are toxic and even our carpets and the paint we put on our walls is healthdestroying  yet weve come to expect that more is better without demanding quality Moving Toward a Shared Economy What is more many of the things we use can be shared Why do we need to own something that we only use sporadically This goes for garden tools and sports equipment as well as human resources even House swapping and Uber were based on peoples growing realization that sharing works Ask yourself  how many times are you actually going to watch that DVD Are you children really going to play with that plastic toy for more than ten minutes before its tossed aside Then theres the clothes we wear for special occasions Often a dress or suit is worn once and then never again Companies are now capitalizing on the trend to reuse and share resources and the trend couldnt have come at a better time Services and space are also growing into the sharedeconomy If you have a garden only you and a handful of people enjoy why not open it up to the community Are you taking your dog for a walk Why not offer to take the neighbors too Or share the fees of a dogwalker with dogloving friends Looking for the Root Cause Through repetitive advertising we have been subconsciously programmed to believe that our lives are empty without more things in them We unknowingly seek quantity over quality in everything we purchase because we are trying to fill an emotional void By playing on our innate emotional responses and our base urges the advertising industry overarchingly promotes the products and services of companies which pollute the planet divide communities rape the earth of its resources and promote slave and child labor If a ruling elite can create docile easily controlled subjects they dont question the goods and services they are being sold let alone its geopolitical agendas This is the undercurrent of an ogilopolistic  mechanized system designed to make consumers  not dreamers thinkers and doers When we start to pull out this programming at the roots and see it for what it is we can start making more informed choices Does this mean we can never buy a new pair of shoes again or travel to a foreign country Absolutely not but it means you can make wiser hopefully fewer purchases and share resources where applicable Instead of staying in a hotel you can make a new friend overseas and trade houses You can purchase goods from companies that give back to their communities and uphold fair trade practices The sustainable company is indeed peeking out from our consumerbased programming and if the Mall of America is closing even for one day it portends a brighter future for Americans who have been obsessed with spending money they dont have for things they dont need Image credit StartatSixtycom  Featured image source Vote Up Christina Sarich Christina Sarich is a musician yogi
