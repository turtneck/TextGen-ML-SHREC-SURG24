Accepting the National Rifle Associations endorsement last week Donald Trump warned that Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment CNN corrected him noting that Clinton has never called for the abolition of the 2nd AmendmentAlthough thats technically true Clinton has done what amounts to the same thing She has interpreted the Second Amendment so narrowly that it imposes no practical limits on gun control laws and that interpretation is sure to guide her Supreme Court nominations if she is elected presidentOn the same day that Trump addressed the NRA one of Clintons policy advisers told Bloomberg Politics the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee disagrees with District of Columbia v Heller the 2008 decision in which the Supreme Court overturned the Districts handgun ban The adviser Maya Harris said Clinton believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft commonsense laws to keep their residents safeSince Heller is the first case in which the Supreme Court explicitly recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to armed selfdefense that statement is roughly equivalent to saying Trump believes Roe v Wade was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft commonsense laws to protect unborn children Just as supporters of abortion rights would be justified in reading the latter statement as a rejection of their position supporters of gun rights are justified in reading Clintons statement as a rejection of theirsClinton confirms her hostility to gun rights by glossing over the details of the DC law that the Supreme Court overturned That law which was the strictest of its kind in the country not only banned handguns the most popular type of weapon for selfdefense but required that long guns be disassembled and unloaded or disabled by a trigger lockAs the Court recognized the latter rule made it impossible for DC residents to use even shotguns or rifles for the core lawful purpose of selfdefense But to Clinton the DC ban was an eminently reasonable safe storage law a paradigmatic example of commonsense gun controlIf the Districts limits on gun possession negated the core lawful purpose of the Second Amendment you might wonder why would a candidate who claims to respect the Second Amendment as Clinton intermittently does say they should have been upheld Possibly because she does not think the Second Amendment has anything to do with selfdefenseI know how important gun ownership and particularly hunting is here in northeastern Pennsylvania Clinton told supporters in Dunmore last month Regarding her gun control agenda she said responsible gun owners have to stand up and say This has nothing to do with my guns my hunting my sport shooting my collectingSelfdefense is conspicuously absent from Clintons list of legitimate things people do with guns The Australian government whose mass confiscations of firearms Clinton admires takes a similar view Australians must demonstrate a genuine reason for owning a gun and personal protection does not countBut Australia has no Second Amendment Clintons campaign website mentions the Second Amendment a dozen times compared to more than 800 mentions on Trumps site not once in the context of selfdefenseThree of those references to the Second Amendment criticize people for taking it too seriously After a mass shooting in Oregon last fall for instance Clinton rejected the NRAs singleminded absolutist theology about the Second Amendment being sacrosanct saying every constitutional right and amendment can be tailored in an appropriate way without breaching the ConstitutionActually its government policy that has to be tailored so that it does not breach the Constitution Restrictions on speech for instance must be narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interestRather than trim her policy agenda to fit the Constitution Clinton wants to trim the Constitution to fit her policy agenda We have to make this a voting issue she says I agree
