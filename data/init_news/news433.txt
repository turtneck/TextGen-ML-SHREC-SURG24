Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britains Daily Telegraph He is the author of the new book Citizen Hollywood How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authorCNN Obama has called the Islamic State the face of evil but hes now under pressure from those who say hes not doing enough to beat it Some insist that an attack on France was an attack on NATO and that its time to go to warBut only a fool would confuse caution for weakness On the contrary to defeat the enemy we have to fully understand who the enemy is what they want and what kind of conflict were involved in here There are good reasons to proceed cautiouslyTo clear something up We are effectively at war with ISIS right now A USled coalition has been bombing targets in Syria and Iraq for over a year and in recent months Russia has been doing the same How well its worked is disputed Obama has rhetorically shifted his objectives from crushing Isis to containing itNevertheless late last week there were signs of success The Kurds took Sinjar  a strategically significant area in northern Iraq Mohammed Emwazi a vicious killer and propagandist was likely killed in a drone strikeParis has obviously eclipsed the news of these breakthroughsWho or what are we fighting ISIS is different from al Qaeda the group behind 911 The latter operated as an alliance of cells spread across the world ISIS by contrast seeks to create a geographic space within which to build a caliphate This shift in strategy perhaps explains why ISIS has been even more successful than al Qaeda at hitting so many different foreign targets with so many different methods  from Sinai to Beirut to ParisISIS caliphate offers a haven for tens of thousands of foreign jihadists They come they train and then many return home to create havoc The caliphate also provides money and the moral encouragement of having an earthly paradise to fight for In his groundbreaking essay on the motivations behind ISIS Graeme Wood describes an ISIS recruiter calling it a vehicle for salvationIts fighters are obsessed with recreating Islam in its earliest form  or as they interpret it to have been because the early caliphate was far kinder  and believe that most other Muslims have fallen from the standard  one that includes the uses of crucifixion and slavery Whereas al Qaeda limited itself to comparatively rational political objectives like expelling Westerners from the Arab peninsula ISIS wants to bring on the apocalypse It is not nihilist It is deeply  if distortedly  religious and we need to learn to take its brand of religion seriouslyThe good news is that ISIS is isolated Applying the phrase world war here is unhelpful because it conjures images of rival equally sized nation states engaged in total war But while ISIS reach is global it does not command sizable support beyond its shifting boundaries Meanwhile the alliance against it is one of the largest and most diverse in history including America Britain France Russia and IranSaudi money may well have once supported it but the Saudi state is now opposed Indeed the exceptional evil of ISIS leads us to view many of the regional political agendas in a different light Iran for instance certainly is exporting its theocratic government to other countries But it doesnt desire the end of the world The regime is murderous and must be contained But it can be engagedThe complexity of Islamic world politics highlights another aspect of this conflict It cannot be resolved entirely by force of arms ISIS has exploited Sunni dissatisfaction with the Shiadominated government in Baghdad This may mean Iraq as a whole has to be split up to work Turkey probably has to accommodate Kurdish desires for a homeland  And most importantly of all Bashar alAssad the dictator of Syria will have to depart the stageThere can be no constructive government of Syria until there is law order and democratic elections that legitimize proper opposition parties If we give rebels the impression that the West wants to force Assad on them again they will resist us tooFinally there is the question of how we handle the Islamic presence within Europe itself This is partly a matter of improving security measures and making sure returnees from Syria dont just disappear into the crowd Theres also a refugee crisis to confront But while the demographic pressures and security problems of allowing hundreds of thousands of people to cross Europe have to be addressed in a firm way theres no escaping the fact that a large settled part of the EUs population is now IslamicAnd how we respond to ISIS has consequences for interfaith relationsSome American politicians have suggested a religious test for refugees seeking access to the United States This kind of prejudiced rhetoric adds to that false sense that this is a world warstyle clash between conservative Muslims on one side and Christian democracies on the other It is also unChristian and cruel Moreover while Americans might fear Islamification as an existential concept we here in Europe have actual experience of living with Muslims  and I can report that the living is easyMuslims are our friends family and coworkers They fear and despise ISIS as much as anyone else And those of us in the centerground of European politics are determined not to alienate or discriminate against citizens who are 100 British French or GermanOf course it is equally irritating to see politicians who seem to counsel doing nothing and Westerners lacerating themselves because they believe their countries are to blame for all the evil in the world ISIS is evil  real concrete evil It must be stopped But we must proceed carefully with a grand game plan and with the desire to build just and representative Arab regimes that last The legacy of poorly chosen words or unilateral action is there for all to see
