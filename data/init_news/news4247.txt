Cesar Vargas  a leading immigration activist  has a message for Hillary Clinton its great that shes devoting one of the first speeches of her campaign to immigration but that doesnt mean were going to be starstruckWere going to look past that Vargas the director of DRM Action Coalition said Because we learned from President ObamaClinton appeared in Nevada on May 5 at a roundtable with unauthorized immigrants as Adrian Carrasquillo reported for BuzzFeed She called for Congress to create a full and equal path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants in the US But she also said that if Congress didnt do that shed keep  and even expand  President Obamas executive actions to unilaterally let millions of unauthorized immigrants get protection from deportation and work permitsThe appearance itself shows that the campaign is working hard to woo Vargas and immigrantrights activists like him Being catered to this early in a Democratic primary is a sign that the party understands not just the importance of the Latino vote but also the power the immigrantrights movement has to motivate this key groupTheres a very good chance that Clintons eventual opponent in the general election will oppose a path to citizenship Only two Republican presidential candidates have even said they want unauthorized immigrants to get legal status in the US But a path to citizenship isnt what advocates care about when it comes to Clinton They see comprehensive immigration reform with or without citizenship as a pretty easy position for any Democratic politician to take in 2015the partisan battle may be over whats in an immigrationreform law  but advocates are looking for clinton to support more executive actionsClinton has a good track record with Latino voters with whose support she handilybeat President Obama in the 2008 primaryBut immigration activists believe theyre far more powerful now than they were in 2008 and Hillarys record with them is another story Even in 2014 her comments on the issue left advocates seriously concernedShe also must contend with how those activists view Obamas legacy on immigration reform Obama took major executive actions in 2012 and again in 2014 to protect millions of unauthorized immigrants from deportation but the immigrantrights movement remembers those actions as something they had to fight tooth and nail for against an often recalcitrant administration Some Latino voters  and advocates  are not over the sting of Obamas 2008 promesa to introduce an immigration reform bill in the first year of his presidency He failed to deliver and at the same time ramped up deportationsClintons appeal to immigration advocates has to go beyond the safe politics of comprehensive immigration reform and take a few risks to ensure their support Her first speech on the topic indicated thats exactly what shell doIn advance of the May 5 speech Clinton political director Amanda Renteria made calls to several advocates for input  including DRM Action Coalition As Vargas paints it the conversation showed exactly the attitude that advocates think theyre up againstRenteria who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in California in 2014 expressed frustration about why the Latino community were not turning out to vote For Vargas and his colleagues thats an easy question to answer The standard talking point that we have been hearing We need to have comprehensive immigration reform  those are more than decadesold talking points and its no longer motivating people Its no longer inspiring peopleIn 2008 Frank Sharry of the immigration reform group Americas Voice was pleasantly surprised to hear Clinton Obama and others go after each other during a primary debate trying to outdo each other on comprehensive immigration reform But the lesson advocates learned from 2008 is that a presidential candidate cant make a promise that only Congress can keep As Clarissa Martinez of the National Council on La Raza points out at this point weve had a Republican president try and not succeed Weve had a Democratic president tryAnd frankly advocates just dont feel it should be a big deal for a Democratic candidate to support comprehensive immigration reform since its traditionally and recently been a bipartisan issue Advocates may be skeptical that a reformer like Jeb Bush could make it out of the Republican primary without running to the right on immigration But the possibilitys still thereIt should be easy to support comprehensive reform says Martinez To advocates it might be a good idea for a candidate to endorse a bipartisan policy or a policy that majorities of Americans support But its not a victory for advocates themselvesSo now candidates have to offer a plan B what happens if Congress doesnt pass comprehensive immigration reform The answer of course is executive action  like the ones President Obama took in 2012 and 2014 which would allow millions of unauthorized immigrant young adults and parents of US citizens and permanent residents to apply for protection from deportation and work permitsBut is defending Obamas actions enough Theyre certainly a point of difference between Democrats and Republicans  every Republican presidential candidate has made some sort of promise to reverse the executive actions though immigration moderates like Marco Rubio and possibly Jeb Bush have left the door open to waiting until immigration reform has passed through Congress to repeal and replace the immigration programsBut advocates arent looking for Clinton to distinguish herself from Republicans Defending what Obamas already done is the minimum she could say says Sharry Theyre looking for her to promise them more than theyve already been promised It doesnt particularly matter to advocates that Obamas 2014 executive actions are currently on hold in federal court everyone in the immigration advocacy world is confident that this is just a temporary setback and the court battle will eventually go the administrations wayThe reality is that these executive actions are going to be associated with President Obama says Vargas Whats her legacySharry puts it differently in order to win advocates respect she has to show them shes willing to stick her neck out Promising to expand executive action would be to me a sign that shes really going to lean into the issue open herself up to more criticism anger from the Republican ranks in order to show the immigrant community and its allies that shes really supportive this time around he saysTheres a policy basis to wanting executive action expanded As pleased as advocates were with the 2014 executive actions its not like all their demands were met For one thing parents of deferredaction recipients including many leading advocates like Vargass partner Erika Andiola were left out In fact thats exactly the group Clinton said she wanted to help nextFurthermore advocates are looking for an answer to what they see as the big unanswered question of the Obama administration if some unauthorized immigrants are high priorities for deportation because theyve committed crimes or have just come to the US and other unauthorized immigrants are low priorities who should get deferred action and work permits what about people who fall into neither category or both Clinton started to answer that question in her first speech saying that immigrants with deep ties and contributions to communities should be allowed to stay But that doesnt fully address the issueIt is however more details than even advocates were asking for As Carrasquillo reported DRM Action Coalition plans to release a memo this week detailing what it wants from presidential candidates but Vargas stresses that theyre having an open conversation with campaigns Its more that theres a commitment that theres more to be done he says than the specificTo put it another way President Obama spent a lot of time protesting to immigration advocates that hed done everything in his power to protect unauthorized immigrants and advocates spent a lot of energy getting him to reconsider The results were the 2012 and 2014 executive actions Advocates are hoping to skip that step  by getting Clinton to start with the assumption that there is more she could do as presidentBetween todays speech about immigration and last weeks speech about criminal justice it sure looks like Clinton is using the beginning of her campaign to make it clear she knows this isnt the Democratic Party that nominated her husband in 1992Clintons never exactly been a champion of immigration reform During the 2008 campaign she famously flipflopped on drivers licenses for unauthorized immigrants as a senator she was supportive of the 2007 push for comprehensive immigration reform but according to Sharry her role was limited to proposing a few safe amendmentsWhat really raised some red flags among advocates though were a pair of comments Clinton made in 2014  when everyone assumed she was gearing up to run for president First she told an audience that she thought most of the children coming to the US from Central America should be sent back  a stance that was much harsher than the one the Obama administration ended up taking Then in Iowa in September when a member of Vargass group asked her if she supported executive action for immigrants she said the answer was to elect more Democrats  something that was insanely tonedeaf given that President Obama had just delayed taking executive action until after the 2014 electionsThat seemed like a return to the way the Democratic Party viewed immigration back in 2007  the last time Hillary Clinton was running for office Theres long been a camp among Democrats thats seen the issue as a balancing act they should be just supportive enough to win over Latino voters but not too supportive or else theyll turn off white voters Sharry of Americas Voice describes this thus Sure immigrations important  but not when its inconvenientImmigration advocates are convinced that Democrats have more to gain from fullthroated support for protecting unauthorized immigrants than they have to lose And after the 2012 presidential campaign when President Obama defeated Mitt Romney largely on the strength of the Latino vote  and then the 2014 campaign when Democrats lost Senate races in states like Colorado after Obamas delay on executive action  they feel theyve made their case and deserve a seat at the big kids tableThe May 5 speech was an indication that Clinton or at least her campaign agreesShe called special attention to the thousands of recent immigrant families whove been put in immigration detention  a signal to activists that she understood the problems with taking a tough approach to child and family migrants And she couldnt have been more explicit in supporting executive action to protect immigrants if there arent enough Democrats in Congress to pass immigration reformThe speech does raise a totally different question  one thats only going to be answered with time whether the Clinton campaign will treat immigration as a special interest issue or as a core part of her campaign platform As Sharry puts it Does she talk about immigration only in front of Latino audiences or does she make it part of her stump speechPart of this is about respect  a recognition that Latino voters have done a lot for Democrats in the past few cycles and a signal that Democrats dont think that speaking to a general audience automatically means white voters But while advocates dont say this explicitly its also a way to prevent a repeat of President Obama in 2008  who made it pretty easy to forget that hed made a promise to introduce immigration reform The more Clinton talks about the need to protect unauthorized immigrants  no matter whom shes speaking to  the more opportunities shes creating for the media and advocates to hold her accountable if she tried to ignore the issue in office
