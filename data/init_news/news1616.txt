Protests and vigils have erupted in major cities and smaller towns across the United States in response to Donald Trumps election as the 45th president last night Students in California also participated in a walkout and there were protests at some college campuses It turns out its important for everyone to vote but also to vote in the correct wayProtesters chanted various antiTrump slogans with some calling attention to Hillary Clintons apparent victory in the popular vote The protest in New York City was organized by Socialist Alternative NYC which blamed the Democratic Party for failing to stop Trump insisting the party should have nominated Bernie Sanders instead of Clinton Based on the results where Trump performed at about the level of the last two Republican nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain while Clinton received millions of votes fewer than Barack Obama did any other Democratic nominee would have done betterSome protesters burned American flags but there were no immediate reports of violence at the demonstrationsprotests in the Bay Area last night over Trumps victory did descend into violence and may do so again AntiTrump protests are not a new thing this election cycle nor is violence although these are the first after the democraticallyheld election on Tuesday In MidOctober video released by James OKeefes Project Veritas showed a Democratic operative bragging about hiring protesters to incite violence at Trump rallies In March Trump then in the midst of his run of primary wins said protests like the ones that occurred in Chicago outside the Trump Tower had energized his supporters Those protests also did not have specific messages on policy In June I wrote that attacks by antiTrump protesters on Trump supporters because of the danger he posed as an imperial president was an exercise in blameshifting Those so concerned about what Trump might do to the country that they feel called to stalk and attack Trump supporters should take a long look in the mirror instead I wrote Itll have the added benefit of not building more support for Trump as violence against his supporters certainly will The tactics and the attitudes underlying them continued and probably helped Trump pull off one of the biggest upsets in modern presidential historyOutside of demonstrations surrounding specific police shootings and the antiTrump protests there seem to have been few major protests in the US in the last eight years over the kinds of policieslike US wars overseas and even immigration policythat purportedly animated protests during the Bush years Certainly the candidate produced by the party that claims to be concerned about these issues did not reflect an electorate that voted based on those issues Clinton was the architect of a number of US interventionists and an advocate of policies like the drug war that contributed to the refugee crisis at the southern border The Obama administration ramped up deportations and has continued to rip families apart into its last yearTrumps election has already reignited concern about these issues The left has rediscovered the usefulness of limited government power as Robby Soave noted Tuesday night Although Republicans retained control of Congress in the elections a number of Republican members did not endorse Trump While failed presidential candidate Sen Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is a prointerventionist fan of executive power others such as Kentuckys Sen Rand Paul could become important advocates of limited executive and government power and noninterventionism Arizonas Sen Jeff Flake another Republican who didnt endorse Trump meanwhile is likely to press Trump and Republicans on immigration Rep Justin Amash of Michigan tweeted a picture of himself Kentuckys Rep Tom Massie and Rand Paul with the the caption Were putting the band back together teamlibertyOn one level the protests are a neat demonstration of the First Amendment and would be so if the roles were reversed although Im skeptical if tonights protesters would feel the same way A progressive friend suggested Trump supporters would have gotten violent if Clinton wonnot an uncommon belief Clinton called the idea that Trump might not accept the outcome of the election as protesters appear to be doing horrific The protesters are also risking the salience of the message against policies there is now an opportunity to try to push a new president in a better direction on and avoid the bipartisan continuity of the war on terror and related policies from the Bush administration to the Obama administrationDonald Trump may personify the problem of unchecked executive power but the problem is with how the system has developed into that position Many Obama voters believed they were voting for change but President Obama brought a lot of Bush policies along with him Guantanamo Bay is still open the US is engaged in military operations in at least half a dozen countries the post911 security apparatus remains in place Obama did not personify the solution to unchecked executive power or violent US foreign policy The solutions have to be codified and woah actually are in the Constitution with a rollback of the decadeslong project of accumulated executive power and a restoration of coequal branches of a Constitutional government If the debates are again made about personalities the opportunity for positive change could be lost yet again
