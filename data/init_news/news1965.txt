Washington CNN A central theme of Carly Fiorinas nascent campaign for the Republican presidential nomination is that she is uniquely positioned to neutralize the historic potential of Hillary Clintons 2016 bidBut first she has to introduce herself to voters who in large part dont know who she isOn the day she announced her candidacy Fiorina sat for two interviews with ABCs Good Morning America in New York Then she hopped on a phone for a midmorning press call with 65 journalists After lunch she was off to Yahoo News studio for a live sitdown with anchor Katie Couric followed by a questionandanswer session using the livestreaming app Periscope That evening she joined Megyn Kelly on Fox NewsThe next day was no different Fiorina navigated eight interviews including Glenn Becks radio show CNN and The Late Show with Seth Meyers Seven more interviews were scheduled Wednesday followed by five press availabilities over the weekend in Iowa New Hampshire and South CarolinaFiorinas exhaustive schedule is emblematic of candidates who enter the race without a lick of national name ID For a candidate whose name barely registers in CNNORC polls conducted regularly since November  Fiorina  and upstart candidates like her  must rely on the medias megaphone to get her name heard Even betterknown contenders like Sens Ted Cruz of Texas Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida did a media blitz after announcing their presidential bidsCandidates with lower name identification must jump at virtually every opportunity to garner media coverage said Republican political consultant Ellen Carmichael who managed press outreach for Herman Cains presidential campaign in 2011 a candidate who started out virtually unknown For some this means creating their own news by saying things the media deems controversial For others it means answering every media inquiry and agreeing to every interview that comes your way More established candidates however have the luxury of passing on requestsThats one luxury that Clinton is enjoyingSince her presidential campaign announcement on April 12 Clinton has not held a formal press conference While on the campaign trail she has responded  reluctantly at times  to roughly eight questions from journalistsEven that count is a charitable one given that some responses have been little more than short exclamations such as Im having a great time cant look forward any more than I am which she said in response to a question about her strategy in Iowa When a reporter in New Hampshire asked about her next stop on the campaign trail she merely said Oh onwardClinton has been so reclusive in the first weeks of her candidacy that the New York Times started publishing questions their reporters would have asked her that day on the campaign trail if they had had the chanceAt this early stage in the race Clinton doesnt need to rely on the media to reach her core supporters She has a Twitter feed with 347 million followers and a new Facebook page that has grown to 800000 online supporters since her announcement in April This week her campaign launched a web series called  The Briefing  which it intends to use to combat what they consider unfriendly media coverageIt would be hard to see how any other candidate could take such a brazen goitalone approachOf course Clintons absence from media interviews does not come without consequenceThis is one of the few instances in which diehard liberal Sanders and conservative Fiorina are in the same boat The CNNORC poll in April found that just 5 of Democratic voters would consider supporting Sanders compared to 69 for ClintonAs the campaign progresses Clinton will become more available for press questions Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson told CNN But as the frontrunner 19 months until the general election her campaign strategists know that journalists will still continue to cover her regardless of whether she answers questionsHer lesserknown opponentson both sides of the aisledont have that benefit
