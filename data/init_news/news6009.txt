At this point Republicans may wish to consider aborting to protect the health of the partyThey have been going after Planned Parenthood over the past few months like so many Captain Ahabs They threatened to shut down the government to defund the group Their insistence on a Planned Parenthood showdown drove House Speaker John Boehner to resign Theyre about to appoint a special committee to investigate Planned Parenthood The partys presidential candidates have made Planned Parenthood a central part of the campaign and House Republicans are manufacturing new legislative vehicles to cut off the groupAnd what do they have to show for itA new Wall Street JournalNBC News poll finds that Americans have a more favorable view of Planned Parenthood than of any other entity tested including the Republican Party and presidential candidates The groups favorableunfavorable impression 47percent to 31percent is actually up slightly from July Whats more 61percent oppose eliminating federal funding of Planned Parenthood Even among the 35percent who support defunding only 9percent favor shutting down the government to do itYet House Republicans pressed ahead with their quest Tuesday hauling Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards before the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for more than five hours of hectoring and fingerwagging about among other things her salary and the groups travel expensesThe hearing came about because of videos released in July purporting to show that Planned Parenthood was harvesting body parts from aborted fetuses for profit In their memo announcing the hearing committee Republicans proclaimed that the disturbing content of the recently released videos raises questions about Planned Parenthoods use of taxpayer funding But the videos turned out to be doctored and committee Republicans declined Democrats requests to have the video maker David Daleiden appear before the panel The committee didnt get the full unedited videos Chairman Jason Chaffetz Utah said because of California court proceedingsTwo hours into the hearing Chaffetz made the startling confession that without the videos we cant have a good discussion about themBut we can shut down the federal government over themDispensing with the videos members of the panel got down to the larger purpose of the hearing harassing Richards and her groupChaffetz flashed a chart on the screens showing that since 2010 the number of abortions at Planned Parenthood has surpassed the number of its cancer screenings and prevention servicesBut no such shift occurred The fine print on the chart showed that the number of abortions 327000 in 2013 never came close to reaching the number of cancer screenings 935573 in 2013 at any pointThe bogus graph didnt seem to matter to Chaffetz who drew the witnesss attention to the crossing lines showing abortions overtaking screeningsRichards said the chart absolutely does not reflect whats happeningI pulled those numbers directly out of your corporate reports the chairman saidIn fact the chart said the source was the antiabortion group Americans United for Life  which Richards pointed out to ChaffetzThen we will get to the bottom of the truth of that the chairman saidThe truth Planned Parenthood gets money for womens birth control STD screenings and the like not abortions  which Richards calmly reminded her inquisitors She left it to Democratic lawmakers to proclaim their exaggerated outrage The misogyny wailed RepGerald Connolly VaRepublicans tried to inoculate themselves against the inevitable war on women charges Chaffetz admitted three Republican women to participate in the hearing there is only one GOP woman on the panel and he started his own remarks by emotionally invoking his wifes work with breastcancer patients RepTim Walberg RMich thought it helpful to say that Im wearing a pink tie in solidarity with womens health issues The majority dodged an awkward moment when RepScott DesJarlais RTenn a prolife lawmaker who according to court records encouraged his wife and mistress to have abortions yielded his time to a colleagueThat colleague Rep Paul Gosar RAriz told Richards youre profiting off death Likewise Rep John Mica RFla proclaimed himself a champion for the unborn while Walberg said weve been brought into a frenzy and a concern about what happens to our babies and Rep Ron DeSantis RFla asked what happens if a child survives an abortion attemptThis would appear to justify Richardss contention that the controversy isnt about Planned Parenthood Its about allowing women in this country  to make other decisions about their pregnanciesAs if to confirm Richardss suspicion 28minutes after the hearing ended lawmakers went to the House floor to vote on legislation restricting abortion  for the 14th time this yearRead more from Dana Milbanks archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook
