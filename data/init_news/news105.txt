CNN Conservatives dissatisfied with Donald Trump have given the Libertarian presidential nominee a chance to take his third party to center stage but Gary Johnson has not exactly been a fixture on the campaign trailLargely eschewing traditional campaign events the former New Mexico governor has instead opted to appear almost daily on multiple news programs and appeal to his solid core of online supportThat could soon change as the campaign considers more regular appearances in the real worldJohnson campaign spokesperson Joe Hunter told CNN Monday the campaign is now undergoing a natural evolution having recently ramped up its fundraising efforts with the stated intention of buying advertisements in key states and beginning to hold rallies across the countryDespite enjoying a brief surge in the leadup to the major party conventions Johnson has generally hovered in the high single digits in national polls The latest CNN Poll of Polls showed Johnson at 9 support nationwideIn a race where the majority of voters say they are dissatisfied with their mainstream offerings for president where the Republican nominee has secured little support from the nations largest generation  millennials  and where digital media has taken an unprecedented place in the political landscape heres what Johnson is  and isnt  doing to make his long shot candidacy a viable betHunter called the constant interviews a critical component of the campaign and after taking scheduling into account We take every opportunity we getSimilar to Trump Johnson and his running mate Bill Weld have relied on earned media in the form of appearances in the pressUnlike Trump the two almost always stay on messageSince winning the nomination at the Libertarian Partys convention in May Johnson and Weld a former Massachusetts governor have used their appearances to cast themselves as the centrist candidates between Trump and Hillary ClintonThey point out their experience as Republican governors in traditionally Democraticleaning states Johnson often touts his laissezfaire approach to drugs and immigration while Weld has pointed to his record on LGBT rights and his cordial relationship with both sides of the aisle including the Clintons Both champion their conservative credos on matters of spendingBut the live television appearances including two primetime town hall events on CNN have not yet afforded the Libertarian ticket national recognition or a strong showing in the pollsOn the digital side the Johnson campaign has largely stuck to its roots by embracing the Libertarian community online Reaching supporters through social media and email the campaign has kept its base abreast of its progress  and appealed for fundsThe Johnson campaign said Tuesday its August money bomb fundraising campaign surpassed its goal of 15 million based off entirely digital appeals for money The campaign said it raised 840000 on Monday alone totaling 29 million in donations in the first two weeks of the monthA number of groups have fallen into place doing some of the heavy lifting that the long shot bid needs doingAmong the most standout recent entries into the Johnson orbit is a newly minted group called Republicans for JohnsonWeld The group formed this month to bring the GOP leaders and voters Trump had alienated into the Libertarian foldRepublican strategist and group spokesperson Liz Mair told CNN Monday the proJohnson forces seeking to convert Republicans from a divisive nominee were in uncharted watersI dont think anybodys tried to launch an effort like this Mair saidDespite the lack of an established path Johnson has notched a few victories Rep Scott Rigell said he will support Johnson in November and Reps Reid Ribble and Mike Coffman have said they are considering itIn separate interviews Hunter and Mair both said they had heard supportive words from Republican politicians but that many were not ready to come out into the open against their partyThe outside group could be a key factor in the mainstreaming of Johnson It already holds several wellknown Republican staffers On Monday it added Joseph Russo III a former Sarah Palin aide Mair saidGiven the nature of the group Mair said a number of us have better connections to GOP Capitol Hill figures than the Libertarian campaignWhat will Mitt Romney doWithin the Johnson campaign Weld has taken the lead on outreach to Republicans However his biggest prize still eludes him 2012 Republican nominee Mitt RomneyRomney served as governor of Massachusetts after Weld and has said if Weld were topping the ticket he would be supporting them but he still needed to hear what Johnson had to say Months have passed since then without a Romney endorsementThe Libertarian efforts to sway Republicans have also had to push back against the notion they are helping ClintonJohnson has said he is pulling about evenly from both sides and been forceful in his condemnation of TrumpMair said Trump was doing the work of helping Clinton on his own and that Clintons win was at this point overwhelming likely although Johnson still had a chance in an unpredictable cycleThe Republicans screwed up Thats not Gary Johnsons fault she saidUp in the airHunter said many people would not come to their side until the Johnson candidacy had reached a critical mass which they hope to achieve by ramping up their campaign efforts and their ad spendingIn addition to television ads the campaign said it was looking at radio billboards and continuing its online effortsAs with the major party candidates outside spending groups have also taken it upon themselves to launch ads in support of Johnson A Libertarian spending group called Americans Deserve Better PAC has put together a few spots hailing the former governors as the adults in the raceRepublicans for JohnsonWeld meanwhile said its focus is less on traditional advertising than generating viral content So far however one of the groups most viral moments came not from distributed content but from an appearance on CNN Ahead of the second Libertarian town hall Mair told CNNs Anderson Cooper that Trumps message is being a loudmouthed d basicallyAll told this third party effort has so far expounded more resources on general election advertisements than Trumps campaign which has yet to join in the air warsAll of these efforts have so far been dwarfed by Clinton and her allied super PACs which have spent exponentially more than the three other presidential campaignsJohnson has not been able to draw the kind of rock star crowd sizes that Trump or Vermont Sen Bernie Sanders attracted earlier this yearThe former New Mexico governor held one rally in Utah on a Saturday earlier this month and another in Reno Nevada After rescheduling he is set to hold another in Albuquerque New Mexico this SaturdayHis campaign said it was still working out specifics on other rallies in the near future but that it planned to host public events soon in Florida and New EnglandMeanwhile fundraising efforts have come largely from the digital side although the campaign said the governors have appealed directly for funds with a planned event in Miami on WednesdayTheir most prominent fundraising event so far came in late July at a Hollywood event hosted by Drew Carey the Libertarian host of The Price is Right
