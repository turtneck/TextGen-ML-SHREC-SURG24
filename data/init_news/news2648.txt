Ted Cruz is a very very conservative guyLike ultraconservative Seriously hyperconservative As in you wouldnt believe how conservativeThat is the unmistakable message of a New York Times piece that aims to plumb the depths of the senators ideologyand near the top notes that John McCain called him a wacko birdIm all for scrutinizing the candidates and their stands on the issues even if this story begins with sort of a foreheadslapping tone We would see more of this coverage of Cruz if the media consensus wasnt that Donald Trump is still the most likely nomineeMost of the media attention surrounding Cruz focuses on his trench warfare to lure delegates away from Trump his response to charges by Trump and some version of the Time magazine question Likable EnoughCruz advisers believe the Texan is softening his testy image by launching a charm offensive This includes joking around with Jimmy Fallon in his Trump wig using his wife Heidi as a surrogate and appearing on CNN with his young daughters They believe Mitt Romney lost in 2012 because many people didnt like him and are trying to avoid that problemCruz is also using more humor telling Good Morning America yesterday that he is the only GOP candidate who doesnt eat pizza with a knife and forkIn the runup to todays New York primary where the Cruz camp is hoping to win a few delegates at best the senator has been attacking Trump as someone who has supported liberal Democratic causes for 40 years So hes hardly hiding the fact that hes a trueblue conservativeThe Times piece starts out with a laundry list It says that on immigration Cruz is to the right of Ronald Reagan who backed a liberalization compromise in 1986 Of course most of the GOP is now to the right of Reagan on this issueCruz opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest and supports an amendment to allow states to avoid performing or recognizing samesex marriagesCruz favors the gold standard wants to abolish the IRS and has criticized Trump on deportation policyfull stopfrom the rightThe larger point of course is that Cruz would be a weak candidate the most conservative presidential nominee in at least a halfcentury perhaps to the right of Barry Goldwater And we all recall what happened to himAnd heres the sortof praise Cruz anticipated the rightward tilt of the Republican Party of today grasping its conservatism even as colleagues dismissed him as a fringe figureCruz told Bill OReilly yesterday that the Times is not exactly a barometer for the mainstream Asked about his position on abortion he said it is Hillary Clintons position on the issue that is radicalI recognize the media loves to focus on issues where they can hit Republicans over and over again Cruz said but that his main focus will be jobsNow theres little question that Cruz could have a rough time when he has to defend his positions on abortion immigration even his flattax plan to a national electorate not just RepublicansEven some mainstream Republicans think he would lead the party to defeat although part of the establishment is reluctantly embracing him as an alternative to TrumpBut in the latest Fox News poll Cruz is in a virtual tie with Hillary Clinton trailing by 1 point while Trump trails by 7 points and John Kasich leads her by 9 On paper at least Cruz and Trump would lose to Bernie Sanders by 12 and 14 points respectivelyFor now Cruz advisers believe they are beating Trump at the delegate game and that some party regulars are insulted by the billionaires attacks on a crooked system These are the kind of delegates they say who would throw their weight behind Cruz on a second ballotIf the race between the two men becomes more competitive expect to hear much more from the media about how Cruz is an unapologetic rightwingerHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of MediaBuzz Sundays 11 am and 5 pm ET He is the author of five books and is based in Washington Follow him at HowardKurtz Click here for more information on Howard Kurtz
