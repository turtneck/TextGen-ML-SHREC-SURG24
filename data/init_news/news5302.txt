The announcement of Debbie Wasserman Schultzs planned resignation as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee was sudden shaking up an otherwise sleepy Sunday afternoon in which most of the political world was focused on making its way to Philadelphia for the partys quadrennial conventionBut if her departure was abrupt  Wasserman Schultz will resign her post when the Democratic National Convention ends on Thursday night  the fall that led to the end was anything but Wasserman Schultzs tenure at the head of the DNC has been rocky almost since the moment she took over the job in 2011Interviews with a variety of pro and antiWasserman Schultz Democrats  and there are plenty of both  suggest that the Florida House members problems were both personal and structural and that she retains a relatively bright future even if this chapter of her political life left much to be desiredHere are the latest most damaging things in the DNCs leaked emailsWhere to start when it comes to the why behind Wasserman Schultzs struggles depends on who you believe is to blame for themSeveral people I talked to put the blame  or at least a large portion of it  on President Obama and his inner circle of political advisers who never cared about the DNC in any meaningful way and as a result left Wasserman Schultz to wither on the vine as they worked around her time and againObama and team never accepted the DNC or cared very much about it and it showed said one senior Democratic strategist granted anonymity to speak candidly Obama was not into party building or party anything He never integrated his political operation into the DNC so she was in a very tough position alwaysFrom the start Obama was never a big party guy He explicitly ran against the party infrastructure and elites in 2008  Hillary Clinton was their candidate  and once he got into office was openly disdainful of many of the traditional apparatus of the partyObama installed his loyal ally Tim Kaine  name ring a bell  as the DNC chair But once Kaine decided to run for an open Virginia Senate seat in 2011 it was clear to anyone paying attention that the next DNC chair wouldnt be a member of the Obama inner circle as he began positioning himself for his reelection bidEnter Wasserman Schultz a Jewish woman from Florida who had a reputation as a dogged fundraiser and willing attack dog on TV For what Obama imagined that job to be she was a natural fitShe wasnt anyones first choice for chair a veteran Democratic operative said But I think most people thought shed be fineSchedule Who will speak in Philadelphia during the 2016 Democratic National ConventionThe counter to that story line is that Wasserman Schultz from the jump seemed dead set on using the perch to promote her own political interests rather than put what was best for Obama firstEven some of Wasserman Schultzs harshest critics acknowledge that part of that problem was structural She was in elected office while also serving as the party chair She was looking to move up the ladder in House leadership and saw the DNC job as a way to do that PeriodShe was far from the only elected official who has struggled to balance the demands of the party chair job with more provincial interests It wasnt great with then Connecticut Sen Chris Dodd or then Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell and it wasnt great with her said one leading Democratic consultant There are always concerns about whose agenda gets put first tensions between official duties particularly votes and political party dutiesBut Wasserman Schultzs emphasis on her own political future  and the need to make sure she was front and center when it came to media attention and interviews  rubbed lots and lots of people the wrong wayShe ignored infrastructure instead focusing on why she wasnt getting more media hits noted a longtime Democratic strategist familiar with the inner workings of the party committee  Fundraising was anemicWhat everyone agrees on is that Wasserman Schultz suffered a series of selfinflicted wounds as chair There was the time she broke with the White House about deporting children detained at the border The time she said Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker had given women the back of his hand Story after story about how she was feathering her own political nest first and then worrying about Obama and the broader party second  or not at all How she found herself on the wrong side of Bernie Sanders and the partys liberal baseOn and on it went For much of the past two years rumors of Wasserman Schultzs demise came across the transom with remarkable regularity And yet she persevered  occasionally via means that left made her detractors even more convinced that she needed to goWhat her increasingly large enemies list could never find was a spark that could set all of the tinder they had gathered aflame That longawaited moment came late last week when a hacker group released more than 20000 hacked DNC emails The emails cast Wasserman Schultz and her senior staff in not only an unflattering light but also as abettors of Clintons march to the Democratic presidential nomination  in effect confirming the suspicions of Sanders and his supportersWithin days years of bad blood with Wasserman Schultz had been unleashed and she had been pushed outWhat does the future hold for the Florida Democrat She faces a primary from a Sandersbacked candidate but most political observers say she will win it Beyond that few people I talked to had any real sense for where she might go next although Dave Beattie a Florida pollster and Wasserman Schultz ally was optimisticI have worked with her a long time he said She is loyal works hard is a staunch advocate for Democrats and is not afraid to raise moneyTime will tell But its hard to see Wasserman Schultzs time at the head of the DNC as anything short of a major disappointment for all involved
