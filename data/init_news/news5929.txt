CNN The contamination of drinking water in Flint Michigan has so outraged community advocates that they now pose a powerful question Was the city neglected because it is mostly black and about 40 poorSeveral advocates say yes They charge that Flint residents are victims of environmental racism  that is race and poverty factored into how Flint wasnt adequately protected and how its water became contaminated with lead making the tap water undrinkableWould more have been done and at a much faster pace if nearly 40 percent of Flint residents were not living below the poverty line The answer is unequivocally yes the NAACP said in a statementOthers go furtherWhile it might not be intentional theres this implicit bias against older cities  particularly older cities with poverty and majorityminority communities said Democratic US Rep Dan Kildee who represents the Flint areaIts hard for me to imagine the indifference that weve seen exhibited if this had happened in a much more affluent community he saidNAACP President and CEO Cornell Brooks drew a direct connection between Flints socioeconomic factors and the toxic drinking waterEnvironmental Racism  Indifference  Lead in the Water  Blood he tweetedBrooks is pressing for a definitive plan of attackWere trying to take action that is specific thats focused thats urgent and speaks to the peoples needs he said Talking with a deadline that has dollar symbols represents action and thats what were trying to doIn an interview with CNNs Poppy Harlow this week Michigan Gov Rick Snyder repeatedly said that he was taking responsibility for the crisis even as she reminded him that his thenchief of staff sent an email in July 2015 to a health department official warning of lead in the Flint drinking water The email was released as part of a freedom of information requestIn October 2014 General Motors stopped using Flint River water at its engine plant because the company was seeing rust of vehicle partsSnyder said that General Motors concern was not a lead issueHarlow responded It was the same issue of the pipes being corroded by the water chemicals in the water just like it is in Flint Its actually the sameThe governor said These are very technical issues But the lead came to my attention in October end of September early October of 2015 We took immediate action need to do more did moreHe said Flint has seen a 45 reduction in crime and he touted a dental program for lowincome children  all moves his administration pushed forIn terms of saying it happened because of the nature of the community here Absolutely notSnyder compared Flints unemployment struggles and other economic woes to what people in Detroit have endured in recent years and he said his administration is responsible for improvements thereThis week Snyder was served with a subpoena by attorneys representing Flint residents who have filed a classaction suit They have asked for the governors emails and text messages going back to January 2011Snyder has released some emails from 2014 and 2015Will you release all of those back to 2011 from personal and work accounts Harlow askedI released the relevant emails my emails that address that issue for the relevant time period said Snyder who has released some emails from 2014 and 2015We are complying with every investigation in terms of being open he added Well follow the appropriate legal process for subpoenas and other legal mattersAgain were complying with every investigation Snyder said Well follow the appropriate legal process for subpoenas and other legal matters With respect to releasing my emails I did that This is an extraordinary caseWhether Flints water crisis happened because the city has poor residents has been discussed in social media particularly by filmmaker and Flint native Michael MooreThis is a racial killing Flint MI is 60 black When u knowingly poison a black city u r committing a version of genocide ArrestGovSnyder Moore tweeted at one pointJust to be clear all 102K residents of Flint have been exposed to toxic water all of Flints kids have ingested lead  10 ppl have died Moore tweeted on another occasionThe Black Lives Matter group said AfricanAmericans especially those in rural and poor areas have long been denied equal access to clean drinking waterOn Monday state Attorney General Bill Schuette said he is appointing an exprosecutor and Detroits former FBI chief to join the investigation into Flints water crisis creating a conflict wall between the states inquiry and the lawsuits targeting the stateThe prior announced investigation will determine whether any Michigan laws were violated in the process that created a major public health crisis for Flint residentsFlints state of emergency  declared at municipal and state levels  began years ago when the city suffered a financial emergency The state took over the citys budget and decided to temporarily switch Flints water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River to save money until a new supply line to Lake Huron was readyThe river however was longknown as befouled Locals call it the General Motors sewerAfter the April 2014 switch residents complained their water had problems Virginia Tech researchers found the water was highly corrosive A classaction lawsuit alleges the state Department of Environmental Quality didnt treat the water for corrosion in accordance with federal law and because so many service lines to Flint are made of lead the noxious element leached into the water of the citys homesThe city switched back to the Lake Huron water supply in October but the damage was already done to the lead pipes The state is now handing out filters and bottled water with the National Guard
