After his shotgun wedding to the presumptive GOP nominee last week the House speaker is getting a glimpse of his future with a man who puts his dreams before anyone elsesTheres no currently available evidence showing that Donald Trumps entire campaign is just one big deliberate effort to troll Paul RyanSince Ryan allied himself with the mogul Trump has engaged in some of his worst behavior of the cycle and his backers show no restraint in their eagerness to malign and mock the Speaker of the House Any hopedfor TrumpRyan Era of Good FeelingsOn June 2 Ryan endorsed Trump He said he made that decision because he believes a President Trump will help pass his forthcoming agendaThrough these conversations I feel confident he would help us turn the ideas in this agenda into laws to help improve peoples lives Ryan said Thats why Ill be voting for him this fallOne day later Donald Trump welcomed Paul Ryan to the rest of his life by saying the federal judge overseeing a civil case against the nowdefunct Trump University is unsuited for the job because hes of Mexican ancestry said judge Gonzalo Curiel was born in IndianaRyan responded to the comments in a press conference he held in Southeast DC to roll out the first item on his policy agenda a series of proposals to fight povertyThe focus of the morning could have been on the fact that House Republicans finally decided to start talking about povertyan issue their party has long declined to focus on But the biggest news Paul Ryan made was his response to TrumpSaying a person cant do their job because of their race is sort of the textbook definition of racist comments he said saying Trumps comments on Curiel should be absolutely disavowedIm not going to even pretend to defend them he added Im going to defend our ideas Im going to defend our agenda What matters to us most is our principles and the policies that come from those principles and our ability to give the people of this country a better way forwardTuesdays press conference was suppose to highlight Ryans latest attempt to turn the page away from the insanity of the presidential election and back to the serious business of lawmaking He has spent the past few weeks cutting campaignstyle videos teasing the release of a series of proposals from House RepublicansThe sad irony of all this is that Trump actually paid lip service to Ryans antipoverty plan when he appeared on CBSs Face the Nation on June 5Paul Ryanwell I think we will agree onas an example he really focuses on poverty Trump told host John Dickerson He wants to take people out of poverty So do I And were going to come up with a planBut that comment was totally drowned out by the criticism Trump drew for saying on the same show that a Muslim judge would probably be just as unfair to him as a judge of Mexican ancestry
