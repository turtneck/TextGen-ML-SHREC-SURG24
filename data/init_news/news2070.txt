The water crisis in Flint Mich is just the tip of the iceberg  and if you think that it cant happen in your community youre sadly mistaken The aging water infrastructure in this country is deeply flawed Many of the 150000 public water systems that serve more than 300 million people are based on rusting leaky pipes and decadesold plans that if not corrected and replaced will have devastating and longlasting effects on our communitiesThe disaster in Flint which began in 2014 when the city switched its water supply from Detroits system to the Flint River in a costsaving measure is likely brewing in many other communities It is inconceivable to me that in the most developed nation on the planet we have exposed families and young children to the poisonous effects of lead And it is almost criminal to me that water supply officials were unaware that the water pumping through a large American city was endangering the community That level of negligence is beyond comprehensionThe dangerous detrimental effects that lead can have on a developing brain and body are welldocumented In 1978 a largely successful campaign to remove lead from home paint products resulted in a new law after it was found that small children could mistakenly eat paint chips and be exposed to lead poisoning When it comes to levels of lead in water no true amount is safe However in 1991 the Environmental Protection Agency EPA established an action level for lead in public drinking water at 15 micrograms per liter and required water supplies to routinely test household tap water to check lead levelsThese laws and others were established to protect our citizens from both indirect and direct exposure to the harmful compound A person can be directly exposed to lead by drinking contaminated water with unsafe levels while indirect exposure can occur when a person inhales contaminated water particles through steam or vaporsOnce lead enters the human body the heavy metal attaches itself to cells that can begin to build up in bones or major organs like the liver or kidneys It disrupts the normal cellular biology of the organ and can lead to chronic diseases However the most dangerous damage lead poisoning can inflict is on the brain especially in young or unborn children If lead is deposited in a developing fetal brain it can disrupt the normal function and cause irreversible damage The same can happen in young children whose brains are still maturingThe consequences can result in low IQ severe delays in cognitive function significant disruption in the memory center of the brain learning disabilities and other neurological deficits The devastating part of this diagnosis is that it is for the most part irreversible Patients exposed to acute lead poisoning can be treated through chelation which is a method used to filter out the lead However for children chronically exposed over a period of time the damage cannot be undoneThis makes the preventable crisis in Flint all the more devastatingI read that the Obama administration is planning to pick Dr Nicole Lurie to act as a czar and fix the crisis in Flint but I urge her to look further than just Michigan Lurie and others must start to seriously evaluate other areas of America where the people are most susceptible to a disaster such as this The government failed the city of Flint it must act now to protect the rest of usDr Manny Alvarez serves as Fox News Channels senior managing health editor He also serves as chairman of the department of obstetricsgynecology and reproductive science at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey Click here for more information on Dr Mannys work with Hackensack University Medical Center Visit AskDrMannycom for more
