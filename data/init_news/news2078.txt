A combat veteran with PTSD wasnt allowed to fly with her service dog So she sued   Since 2011 VNN has operated as part of the Veterans Today Network  a group that operates over 50 plus media information and service online sites for US Military Veterans Vertical Pools Help Heal Wounded Combat Veterans Seeks Positive Doers To Help Make It Happen By VNN on October 31 2016 The Vertical Pool was inspired by the anticipated need of the returning wounded and veterans of all past conflicts who have limited options for recovery and healing at home Even if theyre within an hour of a VA hospital it can be a challenge to get there without assistance A heated sanitized filtered compact pool in the back yard house garage means convenient private daily immersions for exercise traction rehabilitation and recovery These pools should be available to veterans without convoluted forms and wait times Simply a doctors prescription should put them on a list for immediate consideration VetPoolsorg an effort to raise funds to donate these pools to vets was formed with the specific objective of helping improve upon the methods and manners by which America receives and treats her returning wounded The most formidable military force in the world deserves a commensurate comprehensive recovery reintegration program focused on body mind and spirit for those who require assistance The purpose of this message is to inform interested and connected parties of the desire to hand this product and mission off to veterans who would then become The Vertical Pool LLC and VetPoolsorg  They could be instrumental in healing themselves and their fellow veterans as well as civilian America from the physically challenged to the physically fit Interestingly while initially intended for veterans the retail market has turned out to be women As only one person innovatorowner of The Vertical Pool and founderdirector of VetPoolsorg  I cannot fulfill this objective alone The RD pool product and nonprofit are all paid for in full no debt or encumbrances This ondemand pool can be manufactured as needed without excessive costly inventory andor storage space I do not advertise this product because one person cannot build deliver and install more than 5 pools in two months Career options with this DME device and nonprofit include owning manufacturing marketing selling donating fundraising case managing delivering installing and teaching The Vertical Pools diverse functions and benefits This pool is efficient in energy water and space critical qualities in this the 21st century A group or collective of 3 to 7 individuals might be prudent to start the program I would remain teacher mentor and guide for years to come while others slip into the ownership of this product and its sister nonprofit organization Please share this idea with any and all contacts who might have the connections to give some veterans a lead to a worthy endeavor and career To get involved contact Director Peter G Hold
