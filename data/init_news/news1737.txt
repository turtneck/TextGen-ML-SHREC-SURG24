Posted on October 27 2016 by Pamela Geller The bombshells about this criminal are now breaking daily Its not a question of Trump it is an imperative that Hillary be defeated If the people choose Hillary then they must and will be punished Wikileaks Bill Clinton Boasts of Hillarys Working Relationship with Muslim Brotherhood By John Hayward Breitbart  October 26 2016 In a speech Bill Clinton gave at the home of Mehul and Hema Sanghani in October 2015 revealed to the public for the first time by WikiLeaks former President Bill Clinton touted Hillary Clintons working relationship with the Muslim Brotherhoods Mohamed Morsi in Egypt as an example of her diplomatic skillsPresident Clinton also gave his wife a lot of credit for negotiating the Iran nuclear deal in a passage that began with the standard Democrat stuff happens shrugging defense for foreign policy failures Finally we live in a world as I said thats full of good news and bad news The United States cannot control it all but we need a president whos most likely to make as many good things happen as possible and most likely to prevent big bad things from happening You cant keep every bad thing from happening whos most likely to be able to get people involved in a positive way Even the people who dont like the Iran nuclear agreement concede it never would have happened if it hadnt been for the sanctions Hillary negotiated those sanctions and got China and Russia to sign off  something I thought shed never be able to do I confess Im never surprised by anything she does but that surprised me I didnt think she could do it The Chinese and the Russians to see past their shortterm selfinterest to their longterm interest and not sparking another nuclear arms race And when the Muslim Brotherhood took over in Egypt in spite of the fact that we were inaudible she developed a working relationship with the thenpresident and went there and brokered a ceasefire to stop a fullscale shooting war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza which on top of what was going on in Syria and the inaudible Jordan would have been a calamity for the world And when we were trying to reset our relations with Russia under President Medvedev she and her team negotiated a New START Treaty which limits warheads and missiles And she lobbied it through the Senate She had to get 67 votes which means a lot of these Republicans who say that they dont like her now are just kidding for election season They trusted her and she got it passed You cant get 67 votes in the Senate without a lot of Republican support And I dont know about you but with all this tension and Mr Putin trying to affect the outcome of the conflict in Syria I think its a very good thing that were in a lower risk of any kind of accidental nuclear conflict with the Russians She did that Youll rarely find a more tortured political framing of the Iran debacle than Bill Clinton boasting that the sanctions Barack Obama lifted were superawesome as even those who dont think those sanctions should have been lifted agree Mr Clintons version of the Iran sanctions leaves out a few details  such as Russias keen financial interest in keeping Iranian energy out of the European market and Chinas desire to use Iran sanctions as a geopolitical bargaining chip But the part about the Muslim Brotherhood is most interesting If anything he is selling Hillary Clintons working relationship with Egyptian Islamists short because she used American diplomatic leverage for Morsis benefit even before he got elected warning Egyptians about backtracking to a military regime at a key moment of the postMubarak campaign when Morsi was running against a former member of Hosni Mubaraks military There have long been rumors that more subtle forms of US  pressure  were used to secure Morsis office as well Then again in public pronouncements Clinton called Hosni Mubaraks tottering regime stable and cautioned her Obama Administration colleagues against pushing a longtime partner out the door A few days ago declassified State Department documents revealed Clintons talking points for a 2012 meeting with Morsi hailed his election as a milestone in Egypts transition to democracy and stated that she was to offer the Muslim Brotherhood leader technical expertise and assistance from both the US government and private sector to support his economic and social programs Clinton was also supposed to privately offer Morsi assistance with his police and security forces which would be conducted quite discreetly After Morsi was gone she declared herself exasperated with Egyptian political culture and declared herself a cynical realist That is pretty much the opposite of what everyone in the Obama Administration was saying while the Arab Spring was in the midst of springing its little surprises on autocratic but Americaaligned or at least Americafearing regimes which we were all supposed to feel guilty about selfishly supporting for so long As for Clintons superb working relationship with Morsi that eventually ended with Morsis wife railing against Clinton for supposedly dismissing him as a simpleton who was unfit for the presidency and threatening to publish letters from Clinton to Morsi that would damage the former US Secretary of State Meanwhile Mohammed Morsi is developing a solid working relationship with the Egyptian penitentiary system  Egypt has one of those icky military governments again and while it wont have fond memories of Hillary Clintons support for the Muslim Brotherhood regime it will most likely work with whoever wins the 2016 US presidential election Therefore a prospective President Hillary Clinton probably wont suffer too much from Secretary of State Hillary Clintons appalling
