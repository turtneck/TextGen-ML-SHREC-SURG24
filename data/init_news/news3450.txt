Marco Rubioneeding a breakout performance going into Tuesdays Florida primary changed tactics and used substance during Thursday nights GOP debate to attack Donald Trump on several fronts  while Trump subdued and trying to look more presidentialheld steady to the campaigntested themes that have made him the frontrunnerAt the end of the twohour debate Trumpcoming off a string of primary winssummed up the reality that Rubio and rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich face that only two of us can get the delegates to win  meaning Trump and Cruz  and two of us cannot referring to Rubio and KasichThat is not meant to be a criticism  thats just a mathematical fact Trump said urging the party to be smart and unifyThe reminder amounted to just about the toughest criticism of the night at a debate where personal attacks were replaced by more substantive policy discussionBut Rubio in particular who drastically changed his campaign approach in recent weeks to turn up the heat on Trump and even mock his physical appearance dialed all that back onstage Thursday  after having said he regrets some of those personal insultsInstead he hit Trumpon his defense of his Islam hates us remarks Trumps suggestion hed do a deal with the Palestinians and his vow that he wouldnt touch Social Security  despite warnings it would start running out of money in two decadesTrumps rivals though did not criticize him after he was asked about whether his tone is encouraging violence at his rallies a reference to a recent incident where a protester was punchedI hope not I truly hope not Trump said saying he does not condone violence but also that some protesters are bad dudesOne of the most pointed debateclashes came over the diplomatic thaw with Cuba a huge issue in Florida host of the CNN debate and next weeks critical primary Trump tangled with his rivals as he claimed hes in the middle on the issueTrump said something should take place after a decadeslong freeze but I want to get a much better dealWhether Rubios performance is enough is the big question Pressure was already mounting on him to drop out and Texas Sen Cruz added to that pressure Thursday nightThere are only two of us who have a path to winning the nomination  Donald and myself Cruz said while also jokingly referring to Trump as the son of a businessmanRubio entered the debate clinging to life in the GOP primary race after a string of losses He depends on winning his home state of Florida on Tuesday  but polls show Trump well ahead there and even if Rubio wins Florida its still unclear whether he would have any path to the nominationBut he  along with his rivals  did their best Thursday to draw distinctions between them and TrumpOftentimes Trump seemed to lean on his art of the deal to explain his approach to global challenges But it earned him criticism from the others on stageCruz hammered Trump for suggesting hed be able to renegotiate a nuclear deal with IranI will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal Cruz counteredTrump also took heat from Rubio and others as he defended his claim that Islam hates usThe Republican frontrunner said theres tremendous hatred in the Muslim world and called for new laws to confront the threat We better expand our laws or were being a bunch of suckers and they are laughing at us Trump saidBut Rubio and Cruz both said of course they would not want to allow the targeting of family members of terror targets as Trump has called for And they chided him for his remarksThe answer is not scream all Muslims bad Cruz saidThe problem is presidents cant just say whatever they want Rubio said Im not interested in being politically correct  Im interested in being correctTrumps rivals noted America must work with other Muslim nations to confront the ISIS threatTrump also took heat for saying hed try to do a deal with the Palestinians as well as the IsraelisFor the most partTrump and his three Republican presidential rivals held their personal fire Thursday night during their last debate before next Tuesdays primary in Florida  which votes alongside four other statesTrump even remarked on the subdued tone So far I cannot believe how civil its been up hereI think it was good that we had a substantive debate Cruz told Fox News Megyn Kelly late Wednesday The last two debates were pretty ridiculous and I was glad to see that nonsense endingOhio Gov Kasich also stressed at the debate that hes run an unwavering positive campaign all alongBut on the domestic front they did battle on the best way to save Social Security  with Trump breaking from his competition by saying hed leave it alone despite warnings it would startrunning out of money in two decadesI will do everything in my power not to touch Social Security Trump said He said hed instead get rid of waste fraud and abuse including by ensuring the government bids out contractsRubio though said Youre still going to have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that youre going to have to make up He called for gradually raising the retirement age to 70Cruz echoed that call saying the program is careening toward insolvencyWe need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security he saidKasich also called for changes though not necessarily to the retirement ageTrump meanwhile openly discussed his plan to hit pause on green cardsI would say a minimum of one year maybe two years Trump saidAs Trump consolidates support and builds his delegate lead though hekicked off the debate with a pointed message to the socalled Republican establishment effectively telling them to get on board with his campaignHe started his opening statement by claiming his campaign is bringing in Democrats independents and others in huge numbers to the pollsThe Republican establishment or whatever you want to call it should embrace whats happening he said addressing tension between his campaign and senior GOP leaders We are going to beat the DemocratsThe candidates faced off ahead of next weeks critical primaries in five states  including the valuable contests in Ohio and Florida where the winner of each will take home all delegates at stake Frontrunner Trump is riding high after notching three more victories this past Tuesday and is threatening to sideline his remaining rivals next weekPressure is highest on Rubio and Kasich who each have vowed to win their home states doing so widely is seen as essential for them to stay in the race Meanwhile Cruz is positioning himself as the best Trump alternative and the only candidate who could still defeat himHe was buoyed Wednesday by the endorsement of former candidate Carly FiorinaTrump though is set to receive a significant endorsement of his own from an excandidate Ben Carson  who according to sources plans to announce his support for Trump on Friday
