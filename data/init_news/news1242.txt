Donald Trumps October Surprise is so explicit shocking offensive and vile that even he felt the need to apologize  defiantlyIn a video released after midnight Saturday Trump expressed regret for stunning comments that surfaced Friday about womenAnyone who knows me knows these words dont reflect who I am he said I said it I was wrong And I apologizeBut that step  unprecedented for a candidate loathe to ever admit a mistake  may not be enough to rescue a campaign that is now in a fullfledged crisis  And Trump quickly attempted to pivot criticizing Bill and Hillary Clinton in the video and suggesting he would take that argument to Sundays debateBill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied attacked shamed and intimidated his victims Trump said We will discuss this more in the coming days See you at the debate on SundayTrumps candidacy has revealed a long history of demeaning and shaming women But the comments that emerged Friday go further than anything that has been attributed to him before as he seemed to bask in the power he felt his celebrity conferred to do whatever he wanted with womenThe bombshell couldnt come at a worse time for Trumps campaign as he prepares for the next debate against Clinton And Republicans must now decide whether to stand by him or cut him loose just 32 days before the electionThe debate comoderated by CNNs Anderson Cooper is especially crucial because Trump botched his first match with Clinton  and then spent the next two weeks in a cycle of recrimination denial and feud with former Miss Universe Alicia MachadoThe political uproar over the latest revelation was so momentous that it overtook coverage of a hurricane lashing Florida and a stunning US government accusation of a Russian hacking operation to disrupt the electionsIt has been one of the cliches of the 2016 presidential race that Trump can get away with comments and outrages that would sink any normal politician But the video tests the limits of that assumption in a way unlike any of Trumps many previous controversiesI moved on her and I failed Ill admit it Trump said I did try and fuck her She was marriedI moved on her like a bitch but I couldnt get there And she was married Trump adds after saying he took the woman  who is identified only by her first name  out furniture shoppingThen all of a sudden I see her shes now got the big phony tits and everything Shes totally changed her look Trump says of the womanBefore Trump stepped off a bus he and Bush appear to see a soap actress who greets themWhoa Trump says Ive gotta use some tic tacs just in case I start kissing her You know Im automatically attracted to beautiful  I just start kissing them Its like a magnet Just kiss I dont even waitAnd when youre a star they let you do it You can do anything  Grab them by the pussy You can do anything Trump saysTrump advisers huddled in Trump Tower Friday night to plot a path forward They clearly knew they had a problem on their hands when they moved quickly to release a statement that bizarrely blamed Bill Clinton after the Post published its storyThis was locker room banter a private conversation that took place many years ago Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course  not even close I apologize if anyone was offended Trump saidThere were signs that Trumps campaign was in disarray as some of his aides expressed exasperation in unusually blunt termsIts appalling Its just flat out appalling a Trump adviser saidThe stunning developments are forcing a moment of reckoning for Republican Party leaders who have made a pact with a nominee many of them privately view as vulgar and unacceptable and must now decide whether to cut him looseTrump was due to appear alongside Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan and Wisconsin Gov Scott Walker  both pillars of the conservative movement  on Saturday Ryan didnt withdraw his endorsement of Trump Friday but he did condemn the nominee and said Trump will no longer attend the eventI am sickened by what I heard today Ryan said in a statement Women are to be championed and revered not objectified I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves and works to demonstrate to the country that he has greater respect for women than this clip suggests In the meantime he is no longer attending tomorrows event in WisconsinEvery Republican office holder from GOP vice presidential pick Mike Pence  who often calls Trump this good man  to vulnerable senators running for reelection will now face the same question How can you stand with a nominee who would say such a thingSen Kelly Ayotte a New Hampshire Republican running for reelection who stumbled this week over the question of whether Trump represented a good role model for children quickly condemned Trumps statementHis statements are totally inappropriate and offensive Ayotte saidSen Pat Toomey a vulnerable Pennsylvania Republican tweeted that Trumps comments were outrageous and unacceptableTrumps possible implosion also appeared to validate the central theme of Clintons campaign  that a man like Trump with a colorful personal past a life lived in the tabloids and a runaway mouth is simply not fit to be presidentClinton and her top surrogates have been driving a narrative for months that the Republican nominee lacks the gravity knowledge and character to sit in the Oval Office or to represent the United States overseasIt was a case that appeared to be gaining traction given Trumps outspoken comments about Mexicans women Muslims and other sectors of societyTrumps most loyal supporters sought to shrug off the latest controversyWere not choosing a Sunday school teacher Corey Lewandowski Trumps former campaign manager who is now a CNN contributor told Wolf Blitzer on The Situation Room Were electing a leader to the free worldThe controversy is likely to hammer Trumps standing among crucial demographics who may decide the election on November 8Trump had already busted established standards on rhetoric about women in this campaign questioning last year after a tough debate whether moderator Megan Kelly was menstruating and having his words that some women were pigs and slobs thrown back at him by Clinton in the first debateBut the revelations in the hot mic moment will surely doom any hope the GOP nominee has of improving his standing among women voters especially highly educated suburban women in swing states like Colorado and PennsylvaniaDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine campaigning in Las Vegas said Trumps comments makes me sick to my stomachTrumps aides across the country seemed to feel similarlyAsked about the reaction at a campaign field office a Trump field staffer told CNN there were gasps Collective gasps Were trying to get our heads around it right now but theres no way to spin this There just isntThe staffer who is also paying close attention to Senate efforts also added unsolicited Just think of the downballot effect BrutalThis is bad I think this thing is over the staffer said
