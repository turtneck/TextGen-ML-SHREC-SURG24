Negotiations over Irans nuclear program appeared to take a sour turn Wednesday after pushing on past a key deadline but Secretary of State John F Kerry decided to stay in Switzerland an extra day in search of a breakthroughState Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said that progress had been made and that Kerry would remain until at least Thursday morning But the short period appeared to reflect the difficulties in the talks between six world powers and Iran over a preliminary agreement on restricting the Islamic republics ability to use its civilian nuclear technology to build atomic weaponsWe continue to make progress but have not reached a political understanding Harf told reportersThe talks with Iran appeared to be on evermoreshaky ground as the day elapsed The White House said Iran had not made commitments about its nuclear program in Wednesdays sessions and Irans foreign minister described negotiations with the West as always problematicThough the talks continued Germanys foreign minister said it was possible they could collapseThe big questions any nuclear deal with Iran would have to answerIt is clear the negotiations are not going well two prominent Republican senators who have been wary of an agreement  John McCain Ariz and Lindsey O Graham SC  said in a joint statement At every step the Iranians appear intent on retaining the capacity to achieve a nuclear weaponThe Obama administration had sought a broad political framework for an agreement by Tuesday with three additional months to negotiate the technical details But a deadline that perhaps was intended to pressure Iran to make concessions came and went as the countrys representatives bargained hard A temporary nuclear agreement with Iran remains in effect until June 30Diplomats and politicians sounded exasperated Wednesday even as they acknowledged they were still exploring proposals to find a way out of their impasseIn Washington White House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the talks were productive but that there were unresolved details He said the United States would not arbitrarily end the negotiations if they were making progress but if we are in a situation where we sense that the talks have stalled then yes the United States and the international community is prepared to walk awayIn Lausanne German Foreign Minister FrankWalter Steinmeier said that new proposals would be considered but that the two sides were still far apartWhen asked whether the talks could collapse Steinmeier told German reporters Naturally Whoever negotiates has to accept the risk of collapse But I say that in light of the convergence of views that we have achieved here in Switzerland in Lausanne it would be irresponsible to ignore the possibility of reaching an agreementSteinmeier said he would reassess on Thursday morning whether to stay or return home French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius who went to Paris on Wednesday morning was headed back to the talks in Lausanne that nightIrans chief negotiator Mohammed Javad Zarif was critical of his counterparts when he was approached by reporters as he strolled along the shores of Lake GenevaIve always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together they are mutually exclusive he said So our friends need to decide whether they want to be with Iran based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure They have tested the other one It is high time to test this oneEarlier speaking to Iranian reporters outside the Beau Rivage Palace where talks are being conducted Zarif sounded weary with the approach taken by the multiple negotiating teams on the other side of the tableThe negotiations progress depends on political will he said according to Irans Mehr News Agency The other partys political will has always been problematicWith the departure of several foreign ministers who had arrived over the weekend Kerry was joined at the table by the British and German foreign ministers and the European Unions foreign policy chief France China and Russia were represented by their ministers deputiesThe Obama administration and its negotiating partners are seeking an agreement that will sharply limit Irans ability to build nuclear weapons for at least a decade and maintain lesser restrictions in subsequent years Iran says that its nuclear program is for peaceful civilian purposes It is seeking the lifting of international sanctions that have battered its economyThe days negotiations started amid hopes of a preliminary agreement on at least some issuesIranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he expected the talks to end late Wednesday with a statement announcing progress That was quickly contradicted by diplomats from other countriesAraghchi also offered some insight into Irans position on two central issues  the lifting of sanctions and the future of Irans research on centrifuges to enrich uraniumWe insist on lifting of financial and oil and banking sanctions immediately he told Iranian state television adding that the pace for lifting other sanctions was still being negotiatedWe insist on keeping research and development with advanced centrifuges he added referring to Irans desire to eventually replace its outdated centrifuges with more modern technology that enriches uranium more quickly The United States and its negotiating partners want to keep restrictions on Irans nuclear research through the final years of a potential 15year accord They also want economic sanctions lifted more graduallyFor months the State Department avoided the word deadline a term that was used in Congress and the press Officials called it a goal In recent weeks though even US diplomats began using the termWeve said that March 31st is a deadline it has to mean something and the decisions dont get easier after March 31st Harf said MondaySome say the White House should never have adopted the D wordIt was a mistake to set the March 31 deadline in the first place because we need a positive outcome more than anyone else said Gary Samore a former nuclear arms adviser to President Obama Naturally the Iranians are taking advantage and playing hard ballIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kept up his unrelenting criticism of an agreement with IranYesterday an Iranian general brazenly said and I quote Israels destruction is nonnegotiable But evidently giving Irans murderous regime a clear path to a bomb is negotiable he said in a statement from JerusalemHouse Speaker John A Boehner ROhio who was visiting Israel on Wednesday with a congressional delegation said in an appearance with Netanyahu Regardless of where in the Middle East weve been the message has been the same You cant continue to turn your eye away from the threats that face all of usWilliam Branigin in Washington William Booth in Jerusalem and Karoun Demirjian in Moscow contributed to this reportA framework A deal The semantics of the
