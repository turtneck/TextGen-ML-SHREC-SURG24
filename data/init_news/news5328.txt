A State Department spokeswoman said Friday that the department did not start automatically archiving emails from senior officials until February of this year  raising questions about Hillary Clintons claim that her emails were immediately saved whenever she corresponded with colleaguesThe former secretary of state made that assertion during her press conference earlier this week  and in a lengthy statement put out by her office  as she defended her exclusive use of personal email Clinton downplayed concerns that official emails could have been lost by suggesting anytime she emailed anyone with a gov address that email would be stored for posterityThe vast majority of my work emails went to government employees at their government addresses which meant they were captured and preserved immediately on the system at the State Department she said TuesdayBut department spokeswoman Jen Psaki made clear on Friday that this was not the way the system workedShe said the department only started automatically archiving emails for other senior officials in FebruaryThey have long been planning to do this Its just something that it took some time to put in place Psaki said adding that theyll continue to  take steps forwardBefore February these senior officials would have been responsible for flagging their own official records for preservation And as an inspector general report released earlier this week made clear that often was not happeningThe report said that in 2011 employees created just 61156 record emails out of more than a billion emails sent They created even fewer in 2013The report said some employees arent preserving emails because they do not want to make the email available in searches or fear that this availability would inhibit debate about pending decisionsA central part of Clintons argument in downplaying the impact of her personal email use has been that she sent most emails to government colleagues on their gov accounts The written statement put out by her office said her work emails were immediately captured and preserved this way Further Clinton stressed that she cooperated with the department last year in handing over about 55000 pages of workrelated email documents from her time as secretary  her office claimed 90 percent of them already were in the system since they had been sent to gov accountsBut Psakis latest comments would appear to undermine those claimsNate Jones director of the FOIA project at the Washingtonbased National Security Archive told Fox News he had doubts about Clintons assertion from the startThe most important claim she made on Tuesday was that emails were captured and preserved in real time Knowing how far government email systems lag behind those everyone else uses it was extremely doubtful this was actually the case he said The inspector generals report confirmed that just 00006 percent of State Department emails were saved so its very unlikely the people Secretary Clinton relied upon to save her records didTodays disclosure by spokesperson Psaki confirms that the vast majority of her emails were not saved at allClinton also revealed earlier this week that while more than 30000 emails were provided to the department nearly 32000 were deemed by her as private personal records that she did not keep She also said her personal server would remain private
