For those of you salivating  or trembling  at the thought of Hillary Clinton being clapped in handcuffs as she prepares to deliver her acceptance speech at the Democratic convention this summer deep cleansing breath Based on the available facts and the relevant precedents criminal prosecution of Clinton for mishandling classified information in her emails is extraordinarily unlikelyMy exasperation with Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state is longstanding and unabated Lucky for her political idiocy is not criminalThere are plenty of unattractive facts but not a lot of clear evidence of criminality and we tend to forget the distinction American University law professor Stephen Vladeck an expert on prosecutions involving classified information told me This is really just a political firestorm not a criminal caseCould a clever law student fit the fact pattern into a criminal violation Sure Would a responsible federal prosecutor pursue it Hardly  absent new evidence based on my conversations with experts in such prosecutionsThere are two main statutory hooks Title 18 Section 1924 a misdemeanor makes it a crime for a government employee to knowingly remove classified information without authority and with the intent to retain such documents or materials at an unauthorized locationProsecutors used this provision in securing a guilty plea from former CIA director David H Petraeus who was sentenced to probation and fined 100000 But there are key differences between Petraeus and ClintonPetraeus clearly knew the material he provided to Paula Broadwell was classified and that she was not authorized to view it Highly classified  code word stuff in there he told her He lied to FBI agents the kind of behavior that tends to inflame prosecutorsIn Clintons case by contrast there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew or even should have known that the material in her emails was classified Second it is debatable whether her use of the private server constituted removal or retention of material Finally the aggravating circumstance of false statements to federal agents is as far as we know absentThe government used the same statute in 2005 against former national security adviser Sandy Berger who was sentenced to probation and fined 50000 Here too the conduct was more evidently egregious than what the public record shows about Clintons Berger at the National Archives preparing for the 911 investigations twice took copies of a classified report out of the building hiding the documents in his clothesFor Clinton the worst public fact involves a 2011 email exchange with aide Jake Sullivan When she has trouble receiving a secure fax Clinton instructs Sullivan to turn it into nonpaper with no identifying heading and send nonsecure But Clinton has said she was not asking for classified information In any event it does not appear her instructions were followedAnother possible prosecutorial avenue involves the Espionage Act Section 793d makes it a felony if a person entrusted with information relating to the national defense willfully communicates delivers or transmits it to an unauthorized person That might be a stretch given the willfully requirementSection 793f covers a person with access to national defense information who through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust The government has used the gross negligence provision to prosecute a Marine sergeant who accidentally put classified documents in his gym bag then hid them in his garage rather than returning them and an Air Force sergeant who put classified material in a Dumpster so he could get home earlyThe argument here would be that Clinton engaged in such gross negligence by transferring information she knew or should have known was classified from its proper place onto her private server or by sharing it with someone not authorized to receive it Yet as the Supreme Court has said gross negligence is a nebulous term Especially in the criminal context it would seem to require conduct more like throwing classified materials into a Dumpster than putting them on a private server that presumably had security protectionsMy point here isnt to praise Clintons conduct She shouldnt have been using the private server for official business in the first place Its certainly possible she was cavalier about discussing classified material on it that would be disturbing but she wouldnt be alone especially given rampant overclassificationThe handling of the emails is an entirely legitimate subject for FBI investigation Thats a far cry from an indictable offenseRead more from Ruth Marcuss archive follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook
