Statins my disrupt vascular function On the Greenmedinfocom Statin Research database we have cataloged over 15 studies from the National Library of Medicine indicating the heartdamaging properties of this class of supposedly heart friendly drugs View our professional data page here  or if you are not a member view the open access reference page for public view and linking here  Statins do not only reduce lipoprotein production but have socalled pleoitropic properties which include immune system downregulating and antiinflammatory properties which is why they are believed to have a small benefit in reducing the inflammatory burden caused by autoimmune processes in the artery that can precipitate myocardial infarction heart attack in some individuals  but not without having the unintended adverse effect of increasing cancer risk at all sites and contributing to congestive heart failure effectively cancelling out the small mostly theoretical benefit of reduced heart attack risk For instance it has been estimated that at least 23000 lowrisk people would have to take statins for five years to prevent one death from heart disease  Source  Statins are also clearly diabetogenic  increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes by about 50 in some populations  with the FDA now requiring drug manufacturers to include a warning of diabetes risk on statin drug labels  Considering morbidity and mortality from type 2 diabetes is caused not by the elevated blood sugar in and of itself but the damage glycated sugar does to the vascular system and the subsequent cardiovascular harm it produces the case against using statins for primary and secondary prevention of heart disease seems clear as day Moreover cardiovascular harm is not the only concern Statin drugs have been linked to over 300 adverse health effects We issued a consumer alert on the topic several years ago  For the more technically minded here is the database page on Statin drugs listing 300 adverse health effects based on 465 published studies Heart Disease Is Not Caused By A Lack of A Drug Should we be surprised to find so much research on this drug classs adverse health effects After all cholesterol is fundamental for the health of each cell in the human body and low cholesterol has been found to cause a wide range of health problems  including psychiatric states such as violence against self and other The food and drug industries have used cholesterol phobia to manipulate health professionals and the lay public into believing that the cause of heart disease is genetic and can only be addressed through the use of synthetic patented essentially toxic chemicals ie pharmaceuticals or eating semisynthetic low fatlow cholesterol foods with very little nutritional value This latest study speaks to why we must exercise the precautionary principle when considering taking a patented chemical  technically a xenobiotic alien to human physiology  for suppressing a symptom of a much deeper and more complex problem While oxidized cholesterol forms a significant part of the problem of atherosclerotic buildup in the arteries it is not the primary cause of the damage to the inner lining of the arteries endothelium and the preexisting endothelial dysfunction that can go on for many decades silently in the background OxLDL deposits in atheromatous lesions have been viewed as an epiphenomenon generated as part of a cascade of immunemediated events the body activates in order to attempt to heal arterial damage In certain respects cholesterol deposits in the arteries at the site of damage can be likened to a BandAid Do we blame the BandAid for causing the injury upon which it is placed It is important to point out that oxidized cholesterol oxLDL can be toxic and harmful to the vascular system but the problem with modern blood testing for cholesterol is that it does not take into the quality of the lipoproteins only their quantitative dimensions Depending on ones diet environmental factors and overall bodily health LDL particles will oxidize at different rates If you are eating an antioxidant rich diet full of healthy fats phytocompounds etc your properly functioning LDL will be less susceptible to conversion to oxLDL On the other hand eating a diet full of nonessential oxidized fats deficient in phytonutrients antioxidants etc  and adding in environmental toxins and toxicants eg smoking  will produce more oxLDL rendering it artherogenic Obviously therefore diet and lifestyle form the basis for a sound preventive approach if the  lipid hypothesis  of cardiovascular disease is even deemed truly relevant For more research on natural substances which inhibit cholesterol oxidation view our database on the topic Prevent Cholesterol Oxidation  Furthermore there are many ways to address underlying vascular pathologies without suppressing the production of a vital building block and signaling molecule which is what cholesterol is Pomegranate  chocolate  and many other natural substances have been confirmed in research to have profound heart disease preventive and reversing properties  You can explore our database sections relevant to the topic within our Heart Health guide  to find hundreds of studies proving this point Basic nutritional incompatibilities including the consumption of wheat which has cardiotoxic properties in genetically susceptible individuals and excessive consumption of omega6 versus omega3 fats can profoundly increase the risk of heart disease One groundbreaking study published last year in fact indicates that statins actually reduce the health benefits of omega3 fats in the diet  adding another mechanism by which statin drugs exert heart disease promoting effects  Beyond the PharmaceuticallyDriven Medical Paradigm If statin drugs are toxic to human sperm and if the men within whom this statininduced damage is occurring are of reproductive age the implications of this latest study on statins and fertility are potentially devastating to the health of future generations Changes in our species germlines  sperm or egg  are carried on to future generations possibly forever With recent research indicating that even changes to somatic cells in this lifetime are capable of transferring information to the sperm  what we do here and now  our chemical exposures our nutritional status and even our psychospiritual and mental orientation which gear into real physiological and geneticepigenetic processes  can have critical and irreversible affects on our offspring Clearly the time has come both to reevaluate the role of pharmaceuticals in preventive health care as well as the effects these novel new chemical compounds will have on the next generation and the next For alternatives to lipid lowering chemicals take a look at the following evidencebased natural interventions
