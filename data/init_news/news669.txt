Trump has been the leader for several months now but Carson appears to have broken through with key demographics particularly evangelicals The CBS report sums up Carsons advantages wellCarson has made gains across many key Republican groups In a reversal from earlier this month he now ahead of Trump among women and is running neck and neck with him among men Carsons support among evangelicals has risen and he now leads Trump by more than 20 points with this group Carson performs well among conservative Republicans and those who identify as Tea partiersIts not terribly surprising that Carson leads Trump among women and evangelicals Trump is the misogynist par excellence and Carson is a proud religious fanatic  these are natural demographics for Carson But Carsons rising support among men and Tea Partiers relative to Trump is somewhat surprisingTea Partiers dont do policy Their project is essentially negative which is why the GOPs nihilism and obstructionism began in earnest when Tea Partiers were elected to Congress in 2010 Neither Carson nor Trump have anything resembling a platform or a plan Theyre outsiders with no political experience who want to disrupt the status quo  thats a message that resonates with conservative men and Tea PartiersIf theres a difference its that Trump is louder and more aggressively obnoxious than Carson which ought to endear him to these demographics Evidently though Carsons unhinged nice guy routine is working His new campaign ad perfectly illustrates both his appeal and his vacuousnessIn a 30second TV spot Carson manages to hit all the right conservative notes without coming close to explaining what hes going to do Im Ben Carson and Im running for president he says The political class and their pundit buddies say Impossible Hes too outside the box Well they do know impossible Impossible to balance the budget impossible to get border security impossible to put aside partisanshipIm Ben Carson Im running for president and Im very much outside the boxIf youre waiting for the part where he says how hes going to balance the budget or get border security or put aside partisanship you dont know Ben Carson or the new GOP Carson is basically doing the same thing as Trump bashing the political class and promising to fix everything thats broken  only Carson does so with a lukewarm smile whereas Trump pounds his fist on the table with TriStatebravado It doesnt matter that neither candidate has a discernible plan to accomplish any of these things  the empty rhetoric is more than enough for Republican voters One of the more interesting findings in the new CBSNYT poll is that 55 percent of Trump backers say their support is firm while 80 percent of Carson supporters say they could change their minds This is good news for Trump it suggests Carson is far more of a flavor of the month candidate than Trump Whatever the reason Trump has real staying power  hes proven that Carson however remains a question mark He may well win in Iowa thanks to his support among evangelicals but the GOPs last two Iowa winners  Santorum and Huckabee  lost the nomination Trump moreover is wellpositioned in the other early primary states like New Hampshire and South Carolina where he remains comfortably ahead of Carson Carsons boost in the polls will be a boon to his campaign but his longterm viability is still debatable If this trend continues for another month or two however Trump might be in real trouble
