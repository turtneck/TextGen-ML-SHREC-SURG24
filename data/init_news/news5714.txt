When Facebook entered the news business in 2006 it set out to cover its own users Facebook had launched as a static collection of profiles but now every time a user uploaded a new photo or changed her favorite quote the development surfaced in a rolling stream of updates that Facebook called the News Feed Every status update was a news story the algorithm that chose which stories to boost was called the publisher The publisher Facebook told its users at the time was interested in stories like Mark adds Britney Spears to his Favorites and your crush is single again As David Kirkpatrick reported in his 2010 book The Facebook Effect Mark Zuckerberg articulated the News Feeds guiding principle to staff like so A squirrel dying in front of your house may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa The New York Times would cover the African conflict The News Feed would show you the squirrelNow Facebook is poised to begin publishing New York Times stories directly to its own site Last year the Pew Research Center deemed Facebook the secondmost popular source for political and government news among American Internet users just behind local TV Facebook has officially entered the newsnews business What kinds of stories does its publisher value nowA new study published online in Science last week sheds some light Three researchers all Facebook employees culled data from 10 million Facebook users 7 million news articles shared on the site and the users combined 38 billion potential exposures to that content in order to find out how ideologically diverse news and opinion spreads or doesnt among liberal and conservative users They found that the News Feed algorithmwhich has long been accused of shielding users from politically oppositional contentdecreased the visibility of ideologically crosscutting news by 8 percent for liberals and 5 percent for conservatives From there liberals were 6 percent less likely to click on a story from a conservative source like Fox News while conservatives were 17 percent less likely to click over to a leftleaning site like the Huffington Post The Facebook researchers concluded that individual choice has a larger role in limiting exposure to ideologically cross cutting content than Facebooks engineers do All in all users are exposed to more crosscutting discourse in social media than we had all thoughtThe study is a clever bit of misdirection I dont doubt its resultsgetting your news from Facebook isnt as ideologically isolating as say watching Fox News or MSNBC But its title Exposure to ideologically diverse news and opinion on Facebook makes Facebook sound like a pulsing marketplace of political opinion and news Meanwhile Im scrolling down my News Feed and finding videos of Tina Fey fauxstripping and an orangutan cuddling an armful of tiger cubs Facebook may help nudge liberals a little to the left and conservatives a little to the right but its greatest influence over Americans is toward political disengagementThe liberals and conservatives tracked in the Facebook study actually represent a slim slice of the sites users The study included only people who proudly complete the political views section of their profile and just 4 percent of adult Americans on Facebook fit the bill Thats a curious group to focus on because the generation thats most active on Facebook is also the least likely to identify with a political orientation Last years Pew report on the beliefs and behaviors of millennials81 percent of whom are on Facebookfound that a full 50 percent of millennials consider themselves politically independent Their political disaffiliation rivals or exceeds that of any group Pew has ever studied in its 25year existence Instead millennials are building their own networks Pew concludednot through political parties organized religion or marriage but through social media Facebook isnt just facilitating communication between members of different political parties It is replacing political partiesMillennials the New America Foundation found last year are less likely to vote or pledge allegiance to a party but they do engage in some civic uses of social media Slate has a publishing partnership with the New America Foundation Heres one sad data point supporting that conclusion Fortyfour percent of millennials have liked a piece of political material on social media Meanwhile a study published last year in New Media  Society found that being active on Facebook does not encourage teenagers to become more politically engaged It doesnt inspire them to join protests or sign petitions or affix buttons or even post political thoughts on the Internet But it does inspire them to spend more time entertaining themselveschatting with friends downloading songs shopping online and engaging in other consumeristoriented activities This is a convenient outcome for Facebook Its easy to see why Facebook would prefer young people to see Facebook as a shopping mall rather than a soapbox These users are easier to monetize and less likely to offendAfter Eli Pariser Upworthy CEO and the author of The Filter Bubble What the Internet Is Hiding From You parsed the Facebook study he admitted that the algorithms contribution to the partisan divide was smaller than Id have guessed But he also noted that the study elided a more basic question How does Facebooks algorithm manipulate the spread of news in general One of the more revelatory data points embedded in the study concerns the proportion of hard content stories about stuff like campaigns war health care and abortion and soft content links about sports entertainment food gadgets and fashion shared on the site After assessing millions of links the researchers declared over 90 percent of them soft Really soft Examples include a Blind Melon video a Cyber Monday sale and a link to a collection of inspirational photos paired with motivational quotes And the study assessed only the content that links off of Facebook Consider all the engagement announcements and pet photos that dominate your News Feed and Facebooks journalistic priorities appear even fluffierIn theory Facebook presents an unprecedented opportunity for political crosspollination In a 2012 study on polarization and social media Stanford researchers cited studies dating back to 1967 showing that people do not encounter attitudechallenging information in large part due to their social milieu habits and lack of perceived benefits for seeking out such information But on Facebookusers connect with friends past friends extended family members coworkers neighbors and strangers many of whom are likely to hold political beliefs that differ from their own Just dont expect them to talk about it on Facebook Last yearPew studied how Americans discussed Edward Snowdens leaking of NSA documents and found that while 86 percent of Americans would share their opinion among friends over dinner only 42 percent of social media users were willing to post about it online Americans were more willing to share their views if they thought their audience agreed with them And the silence followed Facebook users even after they logged off Facebookers were 50 percent less likely to discuss Snowden in person than nonusers wereSo instead of sparking political debates Facebook users convene over the soft stuff The Facebook researchers found that while pieces of hard news tend to circulate in ideological silos soft content percolates across the aisle I may scroll past one liberal friends links expressing unconditional allegiance to Hillary Clinton but Ill stop and like her video of a Great Dane puppy throwing a temper tantrum This makes Facebook a powerful force for human connection but a poor destination for political engagement The Facebook Effects Kirkpatrick put a rosier spin on the situation Now that we include Facebook on our list of legitimate news sources he said journalists can boast that young people are reading more news than ever before The one catch Theyre just reading about their friends
