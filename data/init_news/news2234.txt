This post was originally published on this site The criminal investigation underway over Anthony Weiners alleged child sex infraction has a couple of characteristics that make it especially awkward for Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin the estranged wife of Weiner and close companion of Hillary Ed Timperlake points out to me that in an underage sex investigation all electronic communications of the investigative target are pursued This probably led to the grand jury that was announced 11 days ago issuing a subpoena for all of the devices in the possession of Weiner and his family including Huma As Lucianne Goldberg quipped they even seize the Speak  Spell toys in these cases This grand jury is in New York possibly less politically supervised than the first Hillary email investigation Evidently some of these devices were not turned over in the first investigation and contained pertinent emails We do not know with certainty but some reports indicate the pertinent emails may have been found on Weiners laptop Recall that the initial investigation did not convene a grand jury and did not therefore have subpoena power It is possible that Huma Abedin misled the FBI over the existence of pertinent emails on her then husbands computing devices So what could have been on the laptop Carlos Danger used for sexting Adam Yoshida with a background in information technology consulting for affluent and powerful people emails Clinton was using emails seemingly like most people use IMs or text messaging Her holding onto Blackberries and seven switching back to older models when the software was upgraded demonstrates this It might even explain at least SOME of the motivation for the email server itself Ive seen plenty of cases where a powerful person says basically I want my emails on this thing and regardless of whether its a good solution people respond readyayeready So what could they have found on Weiners computers that would have caused such alarm Id think one of two things 1 Either that Huma signed in her email account at one point and presumably it being Exchange or IMAP dumped the whole account onto the computer and that account has plenty of emails between her and Clinton that were deleted Or  2 Theres mention of Huma having a Yahoo account to which she would forward things for printing purposes This struck me right away because of course printers are often difficult to configure as are email accounts It struck me as strange yet very believable that she mentioned that shed forward stuff to that Yahoo account to print them I mean printing in theory should be platform agnostic but  if youre technically unsophisticated  you might have serious problems trying to setup an email account or a printer on a device Thus I imagine a scenario where she has a portable machine that either she cant or cant be for some reason configured to use her home printer and a desktop machine I imagine an slightlyolder iMac here thats physically connected to the printer that serves as a shared family computer or whatever She either cant setup the email account on that computer perhaps it requires a VPN or something like that or doesnt want to so she forwards everything that she wants to print to the Yahoo account that she does have setup on that computer The FBI takes this computer as part of the Weiner investigation and bam they find thousands of email messages  again evidence of what was destroyed earlier
