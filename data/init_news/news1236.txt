International Airport in Riyadh Saudi Arabia On early Friday Jan 23 2015 Saudi state TV reported King Abdullah died at the age of 90Saudi Arabias King Abdullah the powerful US ally who joined Washingtons fight against alQaida and sought to modernize the ultraconservative Muslim kingdom with incremental but significant reforms including nudging open greater opportunities for women has died according to Saudi state TVMore than his guarded and hidebound predecessors Abdullah assertively threw his oilrich nations weight behind trying to shape the Middle East His priority was to counter the influence of rival mainly Shiite Iran wherever it tried to make advances He and fellow Sunni Arab monarchs also staunchly opposed the Middle Easts wave of prodemocracy uprisings seeing them as a threat to stability and their own ruleHe backed Sunni Muslim factions against Tehrans allies in several countries but in Lebanon for example the policy failed to stop Iranianbacked Hezbollah from gaining the upper hand And Tehran and Riyadhs colliding ambitions stoked proxy conflicts around the region that enflamed SunniShiite hatreds  most horrifically in Syrias civil war where the two countries backed opposing sides Those conflicts in turn hiked Sunni militancy that returned to threaten Saudi ArabiaAnd while the king maintained the historically close alliance with Washington there were frictions as he sought to put those relations on Saudi Arabias terms He was constantly frustrated by Washingtons failure to broker a settlement to the IsraelPalestinian conflict He also pushed the Obama administration to take a tougher stand against Iran and to more strongly back the mainly Sunni rebels fighting to overthrow Syrian President Bashar AssadAbdullahs death was announced on Saudi state TV by a presenter who said the king died at 1 am on Friday His successor was announced as 79yearold halfbrother Prince Salman according to a Royal Court statement carried on the Saudi Press Agency Salman was Abdullahs crown prince and had recently taken on some of the kings responsibilitiesAbdullah was born in Riyadh in 1924 one of the dozens of sons of Saudi Arabias founder King AbdulAziz Al Saud Like all AbdulAzizs sons Abdullah had only rudimentary education Tall and heavyset he felt more at home in the Nejd the kingdoms desert heartland riding stallions and hunting with falcons His strict upbringing was exemplified by three days he spent in prison as a young man as punishment by his father for failing to give his seat to a visitor a violation of Bedouin hospitalityAbdullah was selected as crown prince in 1982 on the day his halfbrother Fahd ascended to the throne The decision was challenged by a full brother of Fahd Prince Sultan who wanted the title for himself But the family eventually closed ranks behind Abdullah to prevent splitsAbdullah became de facto ruler in 1995 when a stroke incapacitated Fahd Abdullah was believed to have long rankled at the closeness of the alliance with the United States and as regent he pressed Washington to withdraw the troops it had deployed in the kingdom since the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait The US finally did so in 2003When President George W Bush came to office Abdullah again showed his readiness to push against his US alliesIn 2000 Abdullah convinced the Arab League to approve an unprecedented offer that all Arab states would agree to peace with Israel if it withdrew from lands it captured in 1967 The next year he sent his ambassador in Washington to tell the Bush administration that it was too unquestioningly biased in favor of Israel and that the kingdom would from now on pursue its own interests apart from Washingtons Alarmed by the prospect of a rift Bush soon after advocated for the first time the creation of a Palestinian state alongside IsraelThe next month the Sept 11 2001 terror attacks took place in the United States and Abdullah had to steer the alliance through the resulting criticism The kingdom was home to 15 of the 19 hijackers and many pointed out that the baseline ideology for alQaida and other groups stemmed from Saudi Arabias Wahhabi interpretation of IslamWhen alQaida militants in 2003 began a wave of violence in the kingdom aimed at toppling the monarchyAbdullah cracked down hard For the next three years security forces battled militants finally forcing them to flee to neighboring Yemen There they created a new alQaida branch and Saudi Arabia has played a behindthescenes role in fighting itThe tougher line helped affirm Abdullahs commitment to fighting alQaida He paid two visits to Bush  in 2002 and 2005  at his ranch in Crawford TexasWhen Fahd died in 2005 Abdullah officially rose to the throne He then began to more openly push his agendaHis aim at home was to modernize the kingdom to face the future One of the worlds largest oil exporters Saudi Arabia is fabulously wealthy but there are deep disparities in wealth and a burgeoning youth population in need of jobs housing and education More than half the current population of 20 million is under the age of 25 For Abdullah that meant building a more skilled workforce and opening up greater room for women to participate He was a strong supporter of education building universities at home and increasing scholarships abroad for Saudi studentsAbdullah for the first time gave women seats on the Shura Council an unelected body that advises the king and government He promised women would be able to vote and run in 2015 elections for municipal councils the only elections held in the country He appointed the first female deputy minister in a 2009 Two Saudi female athletes competed in the Olympics for the first time in 2012 and a small handful of women were granted licenses to work as lawyers during his ruleOne of his most ambitious projects was a Westernstyle university that bears his name the King AbdullahUniversity of Science and Technology which opened in 2009 Men and women share classrooms and study together inside the campus a major departure in a country where even small talk between the sexes in public can bring a warning from the morality policeThe changes seemed small from the outside but had a powerful resonance Small splashes of variety opened in the kingdom  color and flash crept into the allblack abayas women must wear in public staterun TV started playing music forbidden for decades book fairs opened their doors to women writers and some banned booksBut he treaded carefully in the face of the ultraconservative Wahhabi clerics who hold near total sway over society and in return give the Al Saud familys rule religious legitimacySenior cleric Sheik Saleh alLihedan warned against changes that could snap the thread between a leader and his people In some cases Abdullah pushed back He fired one prominent government cleric who criticized the mixedgender university But the king balked at going too far too fast For example beyond allowing debate in newspapers Abdullah did nothing to respond to demands to allow women to driveHe has presided over a country that has inched forward either on its own or with his leadership said Karen Elliot House author of On Saudi Arabia Its People Past Religion Fault LinesI dont think hes had as much impact as one would hope on trying to create a more moderate version of Islam she said To me it has not taken inside the country as much as one would hopeAnd any change was strictly on the royal familys terms After the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings in particular Saudi Arabia clamped down on any dissent Riot police crushed street demonstrations by Saudi Arabias Shiite minority Dozens of activists were detained many of them tried under a sweeping counterterrorism law by an antiterrorism court Abdullah created Authorities more closely monitored social media where anger over corruption and unemployment  and jokes about the aging monarchy  are rifeRegionally perhaps Abdullahs biggest priority was to confront Iran the Shiite powerhouse across the GulfWorried about Tehrans nuclear program Abdullah told the United States in 2008 to consider military action to cut off the head of the snake and prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon according to a leaked US diplomatic memoIn Lebanon Abdullah backed Sunni allies against the Iranianbacked Shiite guerrilla group Hezbollah in a proxy conflict that flared repeatedly into potentially destabilizing violence Saudi Arabia was also deeply opposed to longtime Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri alMaliki whom it considered a tool of Iran oppressing Iraqs Sunni Muslim minorityIn Syria Abdullah stepped indirectly indirectly into the civil war that emerged after 2011 He supported and armed rebels battling to overthrow President Bashar Assad Irans top Arab ally and pressed the Obama administration to do the same Irans allies Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite militias rushed to back Assad and the resulting conflict has left hundreds of thousands dead and driven millions of Syrians from their homesFrom the multiple conflicts SunniShiite hatreds around the region took on a life of their own fueling Sunni militancy Syrias war helped give birth to the Islamic State group which burst out to take over large parts of Syria and Iraq Fears of the growing militancy prompted Abdullah to commit Saudi airpower to a USled coalition fighting the extremistsToby Matthiesen author of Sectarian Gulf Bahrain Saudi Arabia and the Arab Spring That Wasnt saidAbdullah was not particularly sectarian in a way that he hated Shiites for religious reasons  There are other senior members of the ruling family much more sectarian But he said Saudi Arabia plays a huge role in fueling sectarian conflictAbdullah had more
