Just How Big Is The Asia Trade Deal Obama Wants Its A BeastOne of the most basic facts about the TransPacific Partnership is also the most important Its hugeThe trade deal got over a big hurdle Friday when the Senate voted in favor of giving the Obama administration fasttrack authority to negotiate the deal with Canada and 10 Asian nationsThat leaves the US House and its unclear it has the votes yet If it passes though TPP which has angered many in the presidents party would be by far the largest free trade agreement the US has in effectThe 12 nations involved in TPP make up about 36 percent of global gross domestic product or GDP according to data from the International Monetary Fund That sets the TPP well apart from the 14 free trade agreements the US currently has in effect with 20 countries to be fair the US accounts for nearly 23 percent of global GDP by itselfNot only that but these nations together account for about onethird of global trade according to the Brookings InstitutionSo the TPP stands apart from other trade agreements in its size But thats only one dimension of its impact Another way the TPP is gargantuan is tougher to quantify in a bar graph its scope It not only covers basic trade issues like tariffs but also a variety of other areas like labor and environmental and intellectual propertyThe size and scope of TPP matter because they are at the center of the debate The Obama administration sees the deals broad reach as positive  the agreement the administration says will open up the US to all kinds of new markets and businessAgribusiness companies for example are excited about having new avenues for their products The labor and environmental provisions the administration also argues will force other nations to up their game on those issues leveling the playing fieldNot only that but the TPPs size is all the more important for the one economic superpower that isnt included in it China One of the administrations top arguments for the deal is that in negotiating TPP it writes the rules for trade with a large swath of eastern Asian countries before China can with its own trade agreementsBut opponents like Sen Elizabeth Warren DMass worry about the sweep of the deal Leaked chapters have intellectual property advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation worried it goes too far in areas like extending copyright laws and fair use rules Doctors Without Borders has also argued the deal could make for more expensive generic drugs restricting access to medicine for some consumersHowever some wish the pact went further  environmental groups like the Sierra Club for example believe the provisions wont do enough to address overfishingBut then no one outside members of Congress negotiators and a small group of cleared individuals has access to the pact so its hard to know exactly how far it will or wont go And that is perhaps the source of the most tension in the TPP debate that such a big deal is being negotiated behind closed doorsIf Congress grants the administration fasttrack also known as Trade Promotion Authority it will mean two to four months for public comment before Congress gives the deal an upordown vote with no amendments or debateThe administration argues that this is unprecedented transparency for a trade deal Opponents however believe it would be too little too late in what has now been a sevenyear negotiating process
