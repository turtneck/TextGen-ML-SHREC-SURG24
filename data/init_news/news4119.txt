At the start of the presidential campaign Ted Cruz told voters he would be the only consistent conservative in a crowded Republican fieldThen he confronted the modern GOP  a fractured party in which each faction has a different definition of what conservative meansTo consistently please all of them Cruz has had to be inconsistent with himselfTime and again he has shifted shaded or obfuscated his policy positions  piling on new ideas which sometimes didnt fit with the oldCruz for instance promised libertarians that he would show a strict respect for the Constitutions checks and balancesThen the senator from Texas promised social conservatives that he would scrap one of those checks and balances stripping lifetime tenure from Supreme Court justicesHe criticized Donald Trumps plan for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants Then he seemed to support it He appeared skeptical of military intervention in Syria Then he vowed to find out whether sand can glow in the dark thereCruzs maneuvering has helped him build and maintain a base of support among the partys activist class If Trump fails to win the GOP nomination outright Cruz could have enough backing among Republican delegates to win it after the first ballot at the partys convention in Cleveland in JulyBut while Cruzs rightward shifts might have been politically smart during the primary season they probably would create major challenges during the general election putting Cruz far to the right of most votersNow hes in this wonderful position where hes both the last antiestablishment candidate acceptable who is not named Donald Trump and hes also the last establishment candidate said Matt Welch of the libertarian magazine Reason applauding Cruzs policy shifts Thats just a genius level of maneuveringThe question is What might he believe in the middle of all of that Welch said And I think people have a right to be very skeptical as to whether there is a real core belief systemCruzs campaign did not respond Friday to a detailed list of questions about his policy positionsIts clear that on a number of issues Cruz has been very consistent in his beliefsHe has opposed giving undocumented immigrants a path to US citizenship He says that climate change is not a significant problem defying considerable scientific evidence for climate changeCruz has consistently opposed abortion including in cases in which the pregnancy was caused by rape He opposes samesex marriage But Cruz says that  despite those personal feelings  he would leave decisions on abortion and marriage to the statesThat was of a piece with Cruzs politics during his early years in the Senate He adhered to tea party originalism which believed Washington could be corrected by a return to the limited vision of its Founding FathersWe need to restore the Constitution as our standard Cruz says on his campaign websiteThen after the Supreme Court decision last year that made samesex marriage a right nationwide Cruz said the Constitution needed a changeI am proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution that would subject the justices of the Supreme Court to periodic judicialretention elections Cruz wrote in an oped in National Review Now Cruz said the public would periodically get a chance to throw out judicial tyrants with whom they disagreedHe didnt actually file that proposed amendment but a point was made This was a different kind of conservatism one in which some policies were so important that the Constitution should adapt to themIf Ted Cruz is a constitutionalist he is a soreloser fairweather constitutionalist David Vladeck a professor at Georgetown University Law Center wrote in an email The Constitutions framers would be aghast at Cruzs proposal to undermine the Constitutions main protection against a tyrannical majorityOn the subject of immigration Cruz once championed policies from his partys business wing  including big increases in legal immigration He called for doubling the caps on the number of green cards granted each year and supported a fivefold increase in the number of visas granted to highskilled guest workers known as H1B visas He demurred when asked what hed do with the millions of illegal immigrants already living in the United StatesBut then came TrumpAfter the billionaire used promises of a sweeping immigration crackdown to rocket to the top of the GOP race Cruzs own policies grew sharply tougher He was against any increase in legal immigration He called for the highskilled visa program to be halted for 180 days so that reported abuses in the system could be investigatedRick Tyler Cruzs former communications director said he believes Cruz is to the right of everyone whos running in the raceIf he changed his position on H1B  and its fair to say he did but you have to look underneath it and say Did he change his principle on it No and I think thats the important thing Tyler saidOn the question of what to do with illegal immigrants Cruzs answers grew tougher and tougherFirst Cruz said he wouldnt offer them legal status But he wouldnt follow Trumps lead and deport immigrants en masseThen maybe he wouldYes we should deport them Cruz said on Fox News When asked by host Bill OReilly if he would look for them Cruz said yesOf course you would Thats what ICE exists for Cruz said referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement We have law enforcement that looks for people who are violating the laws that apprehends them and deports themIf Trump had redefined what the most conservative position on immigration was Cruz was going to keep up At rallies now Cruz makes this explicit without saying Trumps name He says he wants to build a border wall and that he already has someone in mind to build itAnother noticeable shift was in Cruzs approach to the federal budgetAt the beginning of his campaign his ideas seemed drawn to please antitax conservatives whose biggest concern was to reduce what Washington raises and spends Cruz proposed instituting a single flat income tax set at 10percent That would be a massive boon to the rich who pay much higher rates now The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found that the top 01percent of earners would get a tax cut equivalent to 29percent of their aftertax incomeIt would also take a massive slice out of overall federal revenue The Tax Policy Center estimated the loss at 86trillion over a decade That was a major departure from past GOP orthodoxy 2012 nominee Mitt Romney didnt want to reduce revenue at allThat was still not as big as Trumps proposed tax cut which the center said would eliminate 95 trillion in future revenueCruz had specific suggestions for what he would cut to partially offset the loss He would eliminate four Cabinet agencies  the departments of Commerce Energy Education and Housing and Urban Development  and the Internal Revenue Service Cruz would shift the taxcollecting function to a new office with less power and fewer employees In fact Cruz wanted a new constitutional amendment to require that the federal budget eventually balanceBut then while campaigning in hawkish South Carolina Cruz added another piece to the planEven as he slashed funding for the rest of the government he promised a spending spree at the Pentagon dozens more warships hundreds more planes thousands more troops Analysts have estimated that the cost could exceed 1trillion  and that it could reach 24trillion  over a decadeAll these promises cant add up Its not possible said Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget He estimated that if Cruz tried to make good on all of these promises  plus another pledge to fully fund Social Security benefits for the near future  he might have to cut all other spending by 85 or 90 percent Its not realistically possible to cut taxes by 8trillion and increase defense spending by 25billion and balance the budgetThat shift was connected to another in Cruzs policies toward the militaryIn the Senate Cruz had voted repeatedly against the bill that sets policy and authorizes funding for the Pentagon often objecting that it did not have enough civilliberties protections for Americans accused of terrorism Late last year Cruz was deeply skeptical of US military interventions overseas  even in Syria We have no dog in the fight of the Syrian civil war he saidCruz has said he remains skeptical of unnecessary foreign interventions but in February he called for an extensive Pentagon buildup He also began to call for aggressive tactics against the Islamic State in Syria The United States would carpetbomb the militants Cruz said and find out if sand can glow in the darkThat has left even proponents of a larger US military wondering about the sincerity of Cruzs positionsI dont buy that he understands what hes trying to do said Chris Harmer a retired Navy commander and national security consultant He said he agreed with Cruz that the Navy was too small but he wondered why he hadnt said so before Ted Cruz should have spent the last four years making a case for This is why the end state of the Navy ought to be bigger  He hasnt done any of that Harmer said
